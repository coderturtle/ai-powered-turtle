## **2. Opportunities / Growth Areas**

### **1. Stakeholder Engagement & Collaboration Style**

- [Name]’s passion for technical excellence is a key strength, but several peers and stakeholders have observed that this sometimes translates as **a lack of openness to alternative views**.
    
- Feedback indicates that in discussions she can at times come across as dismissive or overly confident, which may discourage input from others.
    
- Architecture is inherently a **collaborative discipline** that requires building consensus and bringing people on the journey. Confidence and conviction are important, but so are **empathy, curiosity, and active listening**.
    
- Development focus: strengthen influencing skills through listening, questioning, and positioning ideas in a way that invites participation rather than debate.
    
- If addressed, this will significantly expand her impact and credibility at senior levels.
    

### **2. Pragmatism & Flexibility**

- A second opportunity lies in **balancing long-term strategy with short-term pragmatism**.
    
- [Name]’s desire for well-engineered, scalable solutions is admirable, but we must sometimes accept tactical trade-offs or managed technical debt to maintain momentum.
    
- Architecture’s role is to guide progress, not perfection — ensuring that tactical decisions still move us in the right strategic direction.
    
- Development focus: adopt a “progress over perfection” mindset — help teams deliver incrementally while keeping strategic alignment visible.

## **3. Look Ahead**

**Key Focus for Next Performance Year**

- Continue to **drive delivery of the 2026 event-driven architecture initiative**, ensuring alignment across regions and teams.
    
- Maintain strong architectural hygiene — ADRs, current/target-state artefacts, and platform documentation.
    
- Proactively **cultivate influence through collaboration**: seek to understand perspectives before advocating, and bring others along in decision-making.
    
- Demonstrate **pragmatic leadership** by balancing design rigour with delivery realities.
    
- Mentor less-experienced architects and engineers to extend architectural thinking within the platform domain.
    

**Leveraging Strengths**

- Use strong technical authority and structured thinking to continue anchoring platform evolution.
    
- Channel passion for architecture into **storytelling and engagement** — helping stakeholders see how the vision connects to their goals.
    
- Continue to lead by example on documentation standards and architectural quality.
    

**Path Forward**  
This has been a highly successful year with tangible impact on the maturity of the UKPI Core Platform architecture. Sustaining this trajectory will depend on broadening influence — combining strong technical credibility with inclusive collaboration and balanced pragmatism. With focus on these areas, [Name] is well-positioned for continued success and potential future progression.
