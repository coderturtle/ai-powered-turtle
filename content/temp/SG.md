# **Year-End Performance Summary**

**Employee:** [Name]  
**Role:** Technical Product Owner – Head of Strategy & Governance (Level 4)  
**Reviewer:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Overall Rating:** Further Development Needed

---

## **Overall Rationale for Rating**

The _Further Development Needed_ rating reflects that, while [Name] brought professionalism and good intent to the role, the overall outcomes and level of delivery expected at a Level 4 individual contributor standard were not achieved during the performance year.

This role is a senior individual contributor position, with high expectations for ownership, initiative, and tangible outcomes. While [Name] demonstrated positive collaboration and creative ideas, a number of key deliverables either did not reach completion or did not meet the expected standard of quality, follow-through, and stakeholder engagement associated with this level.

The rating is therefore based on delivery outcomes and behavioural expectations relative to the level of the role — not effort, attitude, or intent.

## **2. Opportunities / Misses**

**Outcomes Not Achieved**

- **Resiliency Program:** Took ownership of the initiative and defined an initial approach but was unable to gain stakeholder alignment and ultimately requested to step back. After several months of effort, there was no tangible delivery or artefact output.
    
- **Townhall Coordination:** The quarterly townhalls were set up and ran as scheduled, but only the minimal logistical effort was delivered. The sessions lacked innovation or structure to help regions stay connected or engaged — an opportunity for ownership and creativity that was not fully taken.
    
- **ITO Narrative and Transparency:** While [Name] contributed to establishing a JIRA instance for EU Architecture, broader objectives around developing a clear, engaging narrative for the ITO group and increasing visibility of the team’s work were not achieved. The planned quarterly newsletter was not delivered after the preferred AI-driven approach proved infeasible, and no alternative execution was pursued.
    
- **AI Experimentation and Synthetic Data Work:** Participation and collaboration were appreciated, but the outputs — including meeting notes and a short summary — did not meet the expected standard of delivery artefacts or demonstrate the depth of ownership expected at this level.
    

**Behavioural Gaps and Missed Opportunities**

- While [Name] contributed positively in discussions, there was limited evidence of proactive follow-through or persistence when encountering blockers or resistance.
    
- At times, appeared to disengage or lose momentum when initial ideas could not be implemented exactly as envisioned, resulting in incomplete or missed outcomes.
    
- Needed to demonstrate greater accountability and autonomy consistent with a senior individual contributor role — taking initiatives from concept through to final, tangible delivery.
    

**Development Opportunities**

- Strengthen delivery discipline and follow-through — ensuring ideas are executed to completion with measurable impact.
    
- Enhance influence and stakeholder management skills to secure buy-in and support for key initiatives.
    
- Develop adaptability in execution — being able to pivot and deliver alternate solutions when constraints arise.
    
- Increase comfort with ambiguity and drive for outcome in self-directed work, particularly where success depends on individual initiative rather than team leadership.

## **3. Look Ahead**

**Key Areas of Focus**

- **Execution and Follow-Through:** Raise delivery standards by translating ideas into well-defined outputs and ensuring timely, visible results.
    
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Focus on influence and proactive communication to build alignment and sustain momentum, even when priorities shift or resistance arises.
    
- **Resilience and Adaptability:** Demonstrate flexibility by adapting plans when initial approaches are not feasible, maintaining ownership and accountability for outcomes.
    

**Leveraging Strengths**

- Continue to apply strong communication and collaboration skills to build relationships and engage cross-functional teams.
    
- Use creative thinking and early-stage ideation as a foundation, but complement this with structured delivery planning and measurable milestones.
    
- Maintain professional composure and openness to feedback as enablers for personal growth.
    

**Path Forward**  
Success is still achievable. The foundation of curiosity, communication strength, and innovative thinking can serve as real assets if combined with stronger delivery focus, execution quality, and stakeholder alignment. The coming year should prioritise demonstrating consistent delivery of tangible outcomes at the expected Level 4 standard, supported by a mindset of accountability, persistence, and adaptability.
