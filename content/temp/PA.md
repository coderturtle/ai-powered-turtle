# **Year-End Performance Summary**

**Employee:** [Name]  
**Role:** Technical Product Architect – UKPI (Level 4)  
**Reviewer:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Overall Rating:** Further Development Needed

---

## **Overall Rationale for Rating**

The _Further Development Needed_ rating reflects that while [Name] has brought strong enthusiasm, collaboration, and solid web and mobile knowledge to the team, the overall **architecture delivery standards and tangible outputs** have not met the expectations for a Level 4 individual contributor role.

This has been [Name]’s first formal architecture position, and it is acknowledged that he has been operating within a complex and sometimes ambiguous environment in the UKPI LOB. Nevertheless, the expectations for a Level 4 architect include driving clarity through that ambiguity — producing documentation, technical direction, and leadership artefacts that demonstrate ownership and accountability.

Despite some positive intent and valuable contributions in team discussions, there has been limited delivery of enduring architectural outputs or visible business impact over the performance year.

## **1. Highlights / Successes**

**Key Achievements**

- Demonstrated strong understanding of mobile and front-end technologies, bringing relevant insights from his prior engineering background.
    
- Built productive working relationships with both product and technology stakeholders within the UKPI business.
    
- Proposed innovative ideas to enhance team culture and consistency, such as the _Architecture Debate Series_ within ARB — an initiative that showed creativity and an intent to build engagement and shared learning.
    
- Volunteered to lead a _thought-leadership white paper_ on future omnichannel experience, showing ambition to shape strategic direction.
    

**Behaviours Demonstrated**

- Positive, approachable, and collaborative team member.
    
- Openly engages in architectural discussions and shows curiosity about cross-functional topics.
    
- Willingness to take initiative through idea generation, even when follow-through has been inconsistent.
    

**Strengths for Future Success**

- Strong mobile and customer-experience background that could add real value to our digital product architecture.
    
- Existing relationships with product and technology leadership in UKPI provide a strong platform for future influence.
    
- Creative thinker who could contribute to forward-looking strategy once core architectural discipline is strengthened.

## **2. Opportunities / Misses**

**Outcomes Not Achieved**

- **Architecture Documentation & ADRs:** Delivered very limited documentation over the year. Key architectural responsibilities such as documenting _Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)_ were not fulfilled — for example, the request to document rationale around consolidating journey team microservices into a monolith was not completed.
    
- **Architecture Definition:** No current-state or target-state architecture diagrams have been maintained for the UKPI digital ecosystem. This has created a lack of clarity for both business and engineering stakeholders on how systems interrelate and where we are heading.
    
- **Vision & Business Partnership:** The UKPI business has expressed uncertainty about their technology vision. A Level 4 architect is expected to guide that conversation — providing options, trade-offs, and impact analyses. This was a missed opportunity to step into that leadership space.
    
- **Technical Direction to Teams:** Technology teams have fed back that they would value more concrete technical guidance and architectural framing to aid decision-making. While there is some ambiguity between architect and tech-lead roles, a Level 4 architect should demonstrate the ability to work through that ambiguity and establish alignment.
    
- **ARB Debate Series:** The proposed debate initiative was an excellent concept but lacked execution — only two sessions held in six months, with no documented recommendations or follow-ups.
    
- **Thought Leadership White Paper:** Volunteered to produce an omnichannel experience paper but delivered only an initial framing. The lack of follow-through meant a missed opportunity to influence the UKPI and enterprise strategy narrative.
    

**Behavioural Gaps & Missed Opportunities**

- Tends to contribute opinions at a conceptual level without translating them into detailed artefacts or documented decisions.
    
- Hesitant to drive or close actions independently when ambiguity arises.
    
- Limited evidence of proactive engagement to capture and socialise architecture artefacts — a key differentiator at Level 4.
    

**Development Opportunities**

- Strengthen _architecture fundamentals_: documentation discipline, ADR management, current/target-state modelling, and use of consistent artefacts.
    
- Build _strategic facilitation_ skills — helping business teams define their vision through structured options and trade-off analysis.
    
- Increase _technical depth and authority_ when engaging delivery teams — ensuring recommendations are backed by detailed reasoning and clear patterns.
    
- Develop _execution accountability_: following through on ideas until tangible outputs are produced and communicated.

## **3. Look Ahead**

**Key Areas of Focus**

- **Delivery Discipline:** Produce and maintain core architecture artefacts — current-state diagrams, target-state visions, ADRs — and ensure they are stored and referenced consistently.
    
- **Business Partnering:** Take the initiative to help product and journey owners shape their future-state ambitions. Provide structured options and quantified impacts to facilitate decisions.
    
- **Technical Leadership:** Work closely with tech leads to co-define patterns, principles, and trade-offs; drive consistency across web and mobile solutions.
    
- **Follow-Through on Initiatives:** Commit to completing the ARB debate series or similar community initiatives with documented outputs and recommendations.
    

**Leveraging Strengths**

- Use mobile expertise and product empathy to bridge user experience and architecture strategy.
    
- Continue to cultivate relationships within the UKPI leadership forums — these provide direct influence channels if paired with stronger delivery.
    
- Apply creativity to make architectural artefacts more accessible and engaging.
    

**Path Forward**  
There is genuine potential for success given [Name]’s subject-matter knowledge and growing relationships across product and technology leadership. Achieving success will depend on **raising the delivery bar**, demonstrating ownership of architecture artefacts, and strengthening technical authority. With commitment to documentation discipline, execution follow-through, and a more structured approach to ambiguity, [Name] can make significant progress toward meeting Level 4 standards.
