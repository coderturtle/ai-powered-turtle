Great — I’ll begin by finding a strong, futuristic codename for your AI-powered investing platform that fits a visionary tone and European/UK sensibility. I’ll also gather guidance on how best to generate the architecture diagrams based on the prompts, especially for integration into Obsidian.

I’ll get back to you shortly with options and suggestions.

# Codename and Diagramming Strategy for a Futuristic Investing Platform

## Visionary Codename: **Moneta**

One potential codename for the AI-driven personal investing platform is **Moneta**. This name is short, memorable, and rooted in financial history across Europe. In Roman mythology, _Moneta_ was an epithet for Juno, known as the goddess of money and protector of funds ([Moneta, The Roman Goddess of Money — Alexandria Stylebook](https://alexandriastylebook.com/alexandria-stylebook/introducing-moneta-accounting-solutions#:~:text=from%20your%20typical%20accounting%20firm,The%20feather)). Adopting **Moneta** as a codename thus subtly conveys **trust and security**, drawing on a legacy of safeguarding wealth. It also resonates with European heritage (the Latin _moneta_ is the origin of the word "money" ([The Origin of the Word "Money": From Juno Moneta to Modern Currency](https://www.thearchaeologist.org/blog/the-origin-of-the-word-money-from-juno-moneta-to-modern-currency#:~:text=The%20word%20,a%20protective%20and%20guiding%20deity))), which can appeal to a UK and European audience by invoking a familiar linguistic root. At the same time, **Moneta** has a modern, tech-friendly sound that would **appeal to a savvy audience** and is highly brandable.

- **Trust & Stability:** The name’s origin as a guardian of the Roman mint symbolizes protection of wealth ([Moneta, The Roman Goddess of Money — Alexandria Stylebook](https://alexandriastylebook.com/alexandria-stylebook/introducing-moneta-accounting-solutions#:~:text=from%20your%20typical%20accounting%20firm,The%20feather)), instilling confidence that the platform is safe and reliable for personal investments and compliant with regulations.
    
- **Innovation & Clarity:** _Moneta_ is an uncommon name in today’s tech market, giving it a futuristic edge. Its clear, two-syllable structure is easy to pronounce and recall, conveying clarity. The historical connection (from which _money_ itself derives ([The Origin of the Word "Money": From Juno Moneta to Modern Currency](https://www.thearchaeologist.org/blog/the-origin-of-the-word-money-from-juno-moneta-to-modern-currency#:~:text=The%20word%20,a%20protective%20and%20guiding%20deity))) bridges tradition with innovation, suggesting a platform that modernizes trusted financial principles with cutting-edge AI.
    
- **Tech-Savvy Appeal:** The codename has a sleek, Latin-based feel that aligns with tech nomenclature (similar to how _Aurora_ or _Nova_ are used). **Moneta** hints at money and intelligence without sounding cliché, positioning the platform as both financially focused and technologically advanced.
    
- **Pan-European Flavor:** Because _moneta_ (or its variants) means “coin” or “currency” in many European languages, the name can resonate widely. It subtly nods to both **UK and European** audiences, reinforcing that the platform is tailored for those markets.
    

_Moneta_ stands out as visionary yet trustworthy. (Alternatively, other light- and clarity-themed names like **Lumina** or **Aegis** could be considered, but **Moneta** uniquely combines financial heritage with a modern vibe.) Overall, this codename signals an innovative financial platform backed by the wisdom of the past and the technology of the future.

## Generating Architecture Diagrams in Obsidian Workflows

In technical documentation for such a platform, clear architecture diagrams are essential. Obsidian (a Markdown-based knowledge base) is well-suited for integrating diagrams, especially with **Obsidian-friendly prompts** (text-based diagram definitions within markdown). Below are recommended tools and strategies for creating architecture diagrams, along with export format and embedding tips for a smooth documentation workflow.

### Recommended Tools for Diagram Creation

- **Mermaid.js:** Mermaid is a popular text-to-diagram tool that works directly in Markdown. Obsidian supports Mermaid **out of the box**, allowing you to embed diagrams by writing a code block with diagram syntax ([Mermaid Tools: improved Mermaid.js experience in Obsidian : r/ObsidianMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/10jco4p/mermaid_tools_improved_mermaidjs_experience_in/#:~:text=,create%20and%20modify%20diagrams%20dynamically)). With Mermaid’s Markdown-inspired syntax, you can quickly generate flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ER diagrams, and more from plain text definitions ([Mermaid Tools: improved Mermaid.js experience in Obsidian : r/ObsidianMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/10jco4p/mermaid_tools_improved_mermaidjs_experience_in/#:~:text=,create%20and%20modify%20diagrams%20dynamically)). This is great for version control and quick edits – simply update the text “prompt” and the diagram updates. For example, a triple-backtick code fence with `mermaid` will render a diagram in Obsidian’s preview. Mermaid diagrams are generated client-side, so they stay within your notes and can be exported as PNG/SVG if needed via tools or the Mermaid Live Editor.
    
- **D2 (Terrastruct):** D2 is a newer “text to diagram” language that offers advanced layout algorithms and a variety of diagram types. It has an official Obsidian plugin ([Obsidian plugin | D2 Documentation](https://d2lang.com/tour/obsidian/#:~:text=D2%20has%20an%20official%20plugin,for%20Obsidian)), meaning you can write D2 syntax in a code block (typically fenced with `d2` after the triple backticks) and Obsidian will render the diagram. D2 is touted as a modern alternative to Mermaid/PlantUML with an intuitive syntax for complex architecture diagrams. Like Mermaid, the **diagram is defined in text** – beneficial for maintainability and using source control. With the plugin, D2 diagrams are rendered inside Obsidian, keeping the workflow integrated.
    
- **PlantUML:** Another text-based diagramming tool, PlantUML uses a simple scripting language to create UML diagrams and more. While not built into Obsidian by default, you can use plugins or external generation (e.g. via a PlantUML server or using **Kroki** service ([diagrams - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/eriktuck/base/diagrams#:~:text=Markdown,and%20the%20paid%20tier%20of))) to embed PlantUML diagrams. It’s very powerful for standardized architecture notations. In an Obsidian workflow, you might write a PlantUML snippet and use a plugin or external call to render it to an image that is then embedded. This is slightly less seamless than Mermaid or D2, but PlantUML supports a wide range of diagram types.
    
- **Excalidraw:** Excalidraw is an open-source sketching/drawing tool with an Obsidian plugin integration. It’s great for more free-form or hand-drawn style diagrams (whiteboard-like) directly within Obsidian. Using the Excalidraw plugin, you can create and edit diagrams in a canvas and embed them in your notes. It even supports LaTeX for math/text, and you can **export the final diagram in many formats (PDF, SVG, PNG, JPG) ([Obsidian has an excalidraw plugin that supports LaTeX both math and text. Then y... | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43352795#:~:text=Obsidian%20has%20an%20excalidraw%20plugin,pdf%2C%20svg%2C%20png%2C%20jpg))**. Excalidraw is ideal for brainstorming architecture or drawing components that don’t require text coding. The diagrams are saved as files (typically `.excalidraw` or `.svg`) in your vault, which you can embed with an internal link. This tool shines for visual clarity and quick illustrations, though complex structured diagrams might be easier with a text-based approach.
    
- **Lucidchart (or draw.io/diagrams.net):** These are GUI diagramming tools that allow precise control and rich visuals (shapes, colors, templates). Lucidchart is a cloud-based solution, while diagrams.net (formerly draw.io) is a free alternative that can be run locally or in browser. They are not built into Obsidian, but you can create your architecture diagrams in these tools when you need polished visuals or collaborative editing. After designing, **export the diagram** to a suitable format (Lucidchart supports PDF, PNG, JPEG, SVG exports ([Export data from Lucidchart - Lucid Community](https://community.lucid.co/product-questions-3/export-data-from-lucidchart-7011#:~:text=That%27s%20correct%20,If%20you%27d))). For instance, you might export a network architecture diagram as a PNG or SVG file and then include it in your Obsidian documentation. There’s even a community plugin for Obsidian that integrates draw.io diagrams (saving them as SVG in your vault) for a more seamless experience. GUI tools are excellent for complex layouts, and they often come with extensive shape libraries (e.g., AWS/Azure icons for cloud architecture in draw.io). The trade-off is that diagram content isn’t text-editable in Markdown, but for final documentation graphics, they can provide a high level of polish.
    

### Export Formats for Diagrams

Choosing the right export format ensures your diagrams appear crisp and accessible in documentation:

- **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):** SVG is ideal for diagrams since it’s vector-based. It scales without losing quality, which is useful for retina screens or if readers zoom in. Mermaid and D2 can output SVG directly (since they are generated from text), and tools like Lucidchart/draw.io allow SVG export as well ([Export data from Lucidchart - Lucid Community](https://community.lucid.co/product-questions-3/export-data-from-lucidchart-7011#:~:text=That%27s%20correct%20,If%20you%27d)). SVGs maintain sharp lines and text, keeping architecture diagrams clear. In Obsidian or web docs, you can embed an SVG just like an image (Obsidian renders SVG in preview). One consideration: if your documentation will be exported to PDF or other systems, ensure they support SVG rendering, or convert SVG to PDF/PNG as needed.
    
- **PNG/JPEG:** These are raster image formats. PNG is lossless and good for graphics (with support for transparency), whereas JPEG is usually not ideal for diagrams (it’s better for photos). PNG exports are widely supported and easy to paste into Markdown docs. The downside is fixed resolution – you need to export at a sufficiently high resolution to avoid pixelation when zoomed. Many tools (Excalidraw, Lucidchart, etc.) let you choose resolution or scale for PNG export. Use PNG when vector is not feasible or if you need a quick snapshot. For example, if a Mermaid diagram in Obsidian isn’t directly usable in an external system, you might screenshot or use a Mermaid CLI to produce a PNG.
    
- **PDF:** A PDF can embed vector graphics and is great for printing high-quality diagrams. Some tools (Excalidraw, Lucidchart) can export to PDF ([Obsidian has an excalidraw plugin that supports LaTeX both math and text. Then y... | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43352795#:~:text=Obsidian%20has%20an%20excalidraw%20plugin,pdf%2C%20svg%2C%20png%2C%20jpg)) ([Export data from Lucidchart - Lucid Community](https://community.lucid.co/product-questions-3/export-data-from-lucidchart-7011#:~:text=That%27s%20correct%20,If%20you%27d)). However, embedding a PDF in Markdown is not straightforward – typically you would convert it to an image or provide it as a downloadable file. PDFs are more useful if you’re preparing a print document or slide deck of architecture diagrams. In an Obsidian workflow, you’d usually prefer SVG or PNG for in-note display, but could keep a PDF version for sharing or printing.
    

_Tip:_ When exporting, prefer **SVG for line drawings** and **PNG for bitmaps or when unsure of reader support**. Always preview the diagram in the documentation to ensure it’s legible (no font issues, not too large or small).

### Markdown Embedding Strategies

How you embed diagrams in your Markdown-based docs (Obsidian or a published site) affects maintainability and interactivity:

- **Direct Markdown Diagrams:** Leverage Obsidian’s support for Mermaid (and via plugin, D2). You can include the diagram **source text directly in the markdown**. For example, writing a Mermaid code block in your note will render a diagram in Obsidian preview ([Mermaid Tools: improved Mermaid.js experience in Obsidian : r/ObsidianMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/10jco4p/mermaid_tools_improved_mermaidjs_experience_in/#:~:text=Obsidian%20supports%20Mermaid,codeblock)). This approach keeps the diagram content version-controlled as text and easy to update by editing the “prompt” (the diagram definition). If you publish your notes (e.g., using a static site generator like MkDocs), ensure the platform can render Mermaid/D2. Some static site tools have Mermaid plugins, or you can use a service like Kroki to generate images on the fly from these text definitions ([diagrams - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/eriktuck/base/diagrams#:~:text=Markdown,and%20the%20paid%20tier%20of)). The benefit here is that the diagram stays in sync with the text and is lightweight to maintain.
    
- **Embedded Image Files:** In many cases, especially for external sharing, you’ll embed the diagram as an image file in your documentation. After exporting a diagram (or saving it via an Obsidian plugin like Excalidraw or draw.io), you can place it in your vault or docs folder and use standard Markdown image syntax: `![](diagram.png)`. In Obsidian, you can also `![[diagram.png]]` to embed a vault image. This strategy is straightforward – what you see is what you get. It’s excellent for finalized architecture diagrams created in Lucidchart or when you want to freeze a version of a diagram. Make sure to store the image at an appropriate resolution or use SVG for quality. If using a static site generator, put the image in the assets folder and reference it accordingly ([diagrams - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/eriktuck/base/diagrams#:~:text=be%20integrated%20with%20your%20documentation,and%20the%20paid%20tier%20of)). This approach decouples the diagram appearance from the source text (the diagram won’t update unless you re-export), but ensures maximum compatibility (any Markdown renderer can show an image).
    
- **Live or Interactive Embeds:** For advanced needs, you might embed live diagrams or interactive content. For example, Lucidchart can generate an embed script or iframe for a diagram (though Obsidian typically doesn’t execute iframes by default in preview). Some specialized tools like Structurizr or Kumu allow embedding an interactive diagram viewer via iframe ([diagrams - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/eriktuck/base/diagrams#:~:text=,IFrame)). In a pure Markdown workflow, interactive embeds are limited, but if your documentation is delivered as a website, you could include an iframe to a live diagram. Another method for “live” diagrams is using an API like **Kroki** or a PlantUML server: your Markdown can include an image link that calls the API with the diagram text encoded, returning a freshly generated image ([diagrams - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/eriktuck/base/diagrams#:~:text=Markdown,and%20the%20paid%20tier%20of)). This way, every time the page loads, it fetches an up-to-date diagram from the text definition. This is powerful for automating diagrams in CI pipelines or published docs, though it introduces external dependencies. Use this approach if you want diagrams to update automatically from source text without manually exporting new images.
    

**Workflow Tip:** Decide early how you want to manage diagrams. If you prefer _diagram-as-code_, stick to Mermaid, D2, or PlantUML in Markdown – this keeps everything in one place and versionable. If you need high-fidelity visuals or collaboration in design, use a drawing tool (Excalidraw, Lucidchart), then export and embed. In many cases, a mix of both is best: for quick internal documentation and iterative design use Mermaid/D2 (fast edits, text diffable), and for polished architecture overviews use an exported graphic. Obsidian supports both approaches, so you can even start with a Mermaid sketch and later replace it with a refined SVG from a design tool.

By using these tools and strategies, your technical documentation can include **clear, up-to-date architecture diagrams**. The combination of Obsidian’s Markdown environment with diagramming tools (text-based or visual) will ensure that your platform’s documentation remains both visually informative and easy to maintain. Whether you’re illustrating an AI workflow, an autonomous investing process, or compliance architecture, you have options to generate diagrams that integrate seamlessly into your notes and can be published or shared with confidence. Always consider the audience and medium—choose a method that provides clarity and readability, reinforcing the innovative and transparent spirit of the platform itself.
