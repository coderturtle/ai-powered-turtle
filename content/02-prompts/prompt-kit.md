# 🧠 Coderturtle Deep Research Prompt Kit

## 🎯 Purpose & Rationale

The **Deep Research Prompt Kit** is designed to help software architects, technical leaders, and AI strategists leverage AI to conduct **structured, high-impact research**. Rather than shallow web searches or ad-hoc prompting, this kit provides:

- A reusable prompt architecture
    
- Guidance on how to ask better research questions
    
- A strategy to evolve AI outputs into decision-ready documents and artifacts
    

This approach is informed by the principles of **retrieval-augmented generation**, **cognitive scaffolding** (Clark & Chalmers, 1998), and **iterative prompting**—all of which help externalize and extend human thinking via AI.

The kit is also grounded in insights from research on human-AI co-creation (Amershi et al., 2019) and prompt engineering patterns from sources like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Microsoft Research.

## 📘 How to Work with Deep Research

### 🪜 Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Define Your Intent**
    
    > What is the real question or decision you’re trying to explore?
    
2. **Select a Prompt from the Kit**
    
    > Choose a base prompt or use the Super Prompt template.
    
3. **Run in Iterations**
    
    - **Scout Prompt**: Quick landscape or comparison
        
    - **Deep Dive Prompt**: Full structural analysis
        
    - **Synthesis Prompt**: Summarize as blog post, white paper, or deck
        
4. **Validate & Expand**
    
    - Check facts and tools via external sources
        
    - Ask for opposing views or counter-architectures
        
5. **Store & Share**
    
    - Save research threads in Obsidian, GitHub, or Notion
        
    - Reuse prompt scaffolds in multiple contexts
        

### 💡 Best Practices

- Be specific in the **persona** and **output format**
    
- Always include **structure** in your prompt (lists, headings, diagrams)
    
- Use modifiers (tone, depth, perspective) to refine results
    
- Prompt recursively: use outputs as new inputs
    
- Keep research versioned and modular in your vault

## 🧰 Prompt Architecture

All prompts follow this structure:

```txt
Act as [role/persona]. Research [topic]. Output [format] using [structure]. Include [modifiers or extras].
```

### Common Modifiers

- **Tone**: executive, academic, blog-style, storytelling
    
- **Audience**: senior architect, founder, regulator, beginner
    
- **Perspective**: enterprise, startup, open-source, futurist
    
- **Format**: Markdown, slide deck, architecture diagram, roadmap

## 🧠 Super Prompt Template

Use this when starting from scratch:

```txt
Act as a hybrid AI research assistant, senior software architect, strategic advisor, and futuristic thinker.

You are tasked with conducting a deep research exploration on the following topic:
**{Insert Topic}**

Output a structured report including:
1. Executive Summary
2. Current Trends & Landscape
3. Relevant AI Tools & Patterns
4. Architectural & Technical Strategies
5. Risks, Gaps, and Validation Methods
6. Skill Shifts and Team Implications
7. Actionable Recommendations
8. Optional Fictional Scenarios or Prototypes
9. Supporting Artifacts (diagrams, prompts, scripts)

Use Obsidian-friendly Markdown formatting with headings, bullet points, and collapsible sections.
