Below is a ready-to-paste **deep-research prompt** that you, as Head of Architecture, can give to an analyst team —or drop back into ChatGPT—so they deliver a decision-ready case for investing in a **stream-first “Lego-block” foundation built on Kafka + Flink + TableFlow¹ + Iceberg**.  
I’ve left a few ‹angle-bracket› placeholders where you can insert facts from your own organisation.

### Deep-research prompt

> **You are** a senior technology leader who leads the architecture function. Produce a board-quality report that justifies, designs and road-maps a streaming-based foundational architecture—using **Apache Kafka, Apache Flink (with Table/SQL layer often referred to as “TableFlow”¹), and Apache Iceberg**—to enable a modular, “Lego-block” approach for building applications and future capabilities such as generative-AI and blockchain.
> 
> #### 1 · Context
> 
> • **Organisation & mission:** “We are a UK based asset management and financial services company, a mid size firm whose mission is to change the way the world invests.”  
> • **Current tech landscape:** “Core platforms: ERP, CRM, data lake, cloud native primarily on AWS.”  
> • **Strategic driver:** “Need for faster product rollout, data monetisation, experimentation ability and readiness for emerging tech.”  
> • **Planning horizon & budget:** “Targeting a 1-3 year horizon, capex envelope 'tbd'”
> 
> #### 2 · Research goal
> 
> Deliver a decision-ready dossier that:
> 
> 1. Quantifies **business value** and ROI of adopting a Kafka-Flink-TableFlow-Iceberg platform.
>     
> 2. Benchmarks peer adoption and industry best practice.
>     
> 3. Presents at least **three strategic options** (e.g., green-field build, phased migration, managed service) with cost, risk and time-to-value profiles.
>     
> 4. Recommends an executable roadmap (people, process, tech) that maximises readiness for **generative AI, blockchain, and other emerging innovations**.
>     
> 
> #### 3 · Key research questions
> 
> |Theme|Investigative questions|Why it matters|
> |---|---|---|
> |**Business value**|• How will real-time, event-driven data flows reduce time-to-insight and shorten product release cycles? • What incremental revenue or cost-savings scenarios (e.g., 10 % faster fraud detection) become possible?|Converts tech spend into board-level KPIs|
> |**Architecture “Lego-block” fit**|• How do Kafka topics + Flink SQL/TableFlow + Iceberg tables compose into self-serve data products? • What design patterns enable plug-and-play microservices?|Validates modular promise|
> |**Generative-AI readiness**|• How does unified Iceberg metadata accelerate vector-store builds and model fine-tuning? • What latency/throughput targets are required for real-time RAG² workloads?|Links platform to hot strategic theme|
> |**Blockchain & Web3 integration**|• Which streaming patterns (e.g., outbox, CDC) best interface on-chain events? • What compliance or audit advantages arise?|Shows cross-domain leverage|
> |**Cost & TCO**|• Five-year TCO of open-source stack vs. managed services (Confluent Cloud, Flink on AWS MSK, Iceberg on Snowflake). • Unit-economics per event and per analytic query.|Grounds decision in finances|
> |**People & operating model**|• Skills matrix: event-driven design, stream processing, data ops. • Target-state org—central platform team vs. federated data product teams.|Ensures adoption|
> |**Risk & governance**|• How do schema-registry, Iceberg time-travel and data lineage aid GDPR & ESG reporting?|Addresses compliance hurdles|
> |**Competitive benchmark**|• How are peers (e.g., Netflix, Shopify, Revolut) exploiting streaming + Iceberg? What ROI stories are public?|Builds urgency|
> 
> #### 4 · Required deliverables
> 
> 5. **Executive brief (≤ 3 pp.)**—business case & headline recommendation.
>     
> 6. **30-slide deck**—vision, options matrix, cost model, roadmap, KPIs.
>     
> 7. **Technical reference stack diagram** showing layers, data contracts, DevEx tooling.
>     
> 8. **Financial model**—five-year cash-flow, NPV, sensitivity to volume & cloud-cost swings.
>     
> 9. **Risk register & mitigation plan.**
>     
> 
> #### 5 · Sources & evidence rules
> 
> • Prioritise peer-reviewed or analyst research **2024-2025**.  
> • Cite at least three case studies where streaming + Iceberg improved business metrics.  
> • Include UK-specific regulatory context (GDPR, FCA, Digital Markets Act) if relevant.  
> • Attach an annotated bibliography (links + 1-line takeaway each).
> 
> #### 6 · Output format & style
> 
> • Provide PowerPoint (.pptx) + Excel/CSV for the cost model.  
> • Use clear visuals: swim-lane roadmap, event-driven reference architecture, TCO waterfall, KPI heat-map.  
> • Keep jargon minimal; define Kafka topics, partitions, stream-table duality, etc. on first mention.
> 
> **Footnotes:**  
> ¹ _“TableFlow” is used here as shorthand for Flink’s Table/SQL API layer; adjust name if your organisation uses a different term or commercial variant._  
> ² _RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a common generative-AI pattern._

#### How to use

1. **Replace** the ‹angle-bracket› fields with your company data, budget, and decision timeline.
    
2. Hand the prompt to an internal research team or to ChatGPT.
    
3. Review first-cut findings, then iterate—e.g., deepen the generative-AI cost-benefit or compare Confluent vs. Redpanda for Kafka.
    

When you’re ready, I can craft a sample **table of contents**, flesh out the **financial-model template**, or even generate the **architecture diagram**. Just let me know what’s next!
