# From Friction to Flow: Automating GenAI Governance to Unlock Value

Our current GenAI approval process is a **logjam of manual checks**. Each new AI tool or use case must “stop for inspection” through legal, risk, security, and compliance gates – like cars halted at a tollbooth【39†】. This creates an “AI customs border” where projects queue up behind paperwork and handoffs. With global financial fines rising (>$6.6B in 2023 alone) and new EU/UK AI rules on the horizon, delays aren’t just inconvenient – they carry real regulatory and opportunity cost. In contrast, studies show **automation slashes manual effort by 30–50%**. By embedding smart workflows and AI assistants, we can transform compliance from a roadblock into a **rapid greenlight**, dramatically cutting weeks off approval times and freeing skilled staff for higher-value work.

The stakes are urgent. Each week lost in manual review equates to missed AI-driven efficiency (fraud detection, customer engagement, etc.). A proactive, automated governance pipeline – essentially an “AI express lane” – can recoup hundreds of productive hours per year. Early benchmarking suggests even **modest automation** (30% cycle-time cut) would pay back any £1.6m investment within a few years, while unlocking significant revenue upside. Our proposal calls for a 12‑month, phased programme to build this pipeline: deploying assistive GenAI (chatbots, summarizers), BPM orchestration, and logging/audit tools. Crucially, this keeps compliance _by design_, meeting UK/EU obligations without slowing us down. The following sections detail the evolving AI regulations, our current manual workflow, pain points, automation opportunities, peer precedents, and a costed delivery roadmap – making the case that **we must act now** to shift from bottleneck to “flow”.

## 2. Regulatory Environment

**EU AI Act (2026):** In June 2024 the EU adopted the world’s first AI regulation. It phases in requirements from 2025–27: by Feb 2025 certain bans (e.g. biometric surveillance) and transparency duties begin, and by Aug 2025 **high-risk AI rules** kick in (governance, data quality, documentation for any AI models used in critical finance processes). All remaining provisions (e.g. post-market monitoring, risk management) apply by Aug 2026. Any “model risk” analytics we deploy (fraud/bias checks, automated decisions, customer insights) will likely fall under this. Non‑compliance could trigger heavy fines (up to 4% of global turnover), so our processes must produce audit-ready evidence – exactly what a proper governance pipeline provides.

**GDPR & UK Data Law:** Under GDPR, using personal data in AI requires safeguards. High-risk processing (profiling customers, automated credit decisions) mandates Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and human oversight. The new UK Data (Use and Access) Bill (expected 2025) will _relax_ the ban on purely automated decisions but only if firms implement protections (e.g. human review for “significant effect” cases). In short, both EU and UK still emphasize fairness and transparency. Our governance workflow must ensure DPIAs are done _once per use case_, bias tests are documented, and data lineage is traceable, meeting Article 22/Article 35 requirements. In practice, this means building forms and checklists into the workflow, not relying on tribal knowledge.

**DORA (Jan 2025):** The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act, effective 17 Jan 2025, demands uniform ICT risk management and incident reporting for all financial technology. Any AI service – especially if cloud-hosted – counts as an ICT third-party service. DORA requires us to map AI dependencies (e.g. cloud LLM provider), enforce continuity plans, run resilience tests, and report incidents (cyber or model failures) promptly. Our automated pipeline can log every AI system request, track performance issues, and trigger alerts, turning DORA compliance into a by-product of good process.

**FCA/PRA Oversight (UK):** UK regulators are not introducing separate AI laws yet, but they treat AI risks as falling under existing regimes. The FCA’s recent report on AI emphasizes that the **Senior Managers & Certification Regime (SM&CR)** already holds leadership accountable for AI systems. For example, SMF24 (Chief Operations) would cover technology controls, SMF4 (Chief Risk) covers risk management of algorithms, and firms must document which senior owns each AI initiative. Our governance process should assign clear accountabilities at each stage and archive approvals, satisfying SM&CR statements of responsibility. Moreover, existing rules like the Consumer Duty and Principle 6/7 require fairness and clarity – meaning any biased or opaque AI decision could breach conduct rules. Automating the checklist ensures no step (e.g. bias review, vulnerability assessment) is skipped.

**Summary of Upcoming Milestones:**

- **AI Act:** In force Aug ’24; partial apply Feb ’25 and Aug ’25; full regime by Aug ’26.
    
- **GDPR/UK DUA:** Ongoing, with UK bill (expected 2025) amending automated decision rules.
    
- **DORA:** Applies Jan ’25; mandates ICT risk frameworks.
    
- **FCA/PRA:** Principles/guidance (Dec ’23 AI Report) in effect now; SM&CR enforcement continuous.
    

These overlapping regulations mean **Audit & Accountability** are non-negotiable by 2025. Our automation initiative must directly respond to them – formalizing roles, evidence trails, and checks into the workflow so compliance is maintained by design.

## 3. Current Workflow (Manual)

Our existing GenAI governance is **serial and manual**. Roughly speaking, it looks like:

- **Idea Submission:** An employee proposes a new AI tool or use case. They fill a free‑form memo or ticket.
    
- **Preliminary Review:** The AI Strategy or Innovation team triages feasibility. (Often back-and-forth email to clarify requirements.)
    
- **Risk & Legal Intake:** Paper forms go to Risk, Legal, and Privacy teams for comments. Each writes a narrative DPIA or risk memo.
    
- **Technical Assessment:** InfoSec or Cloud Ops reviews security impact (data flows, authentication). Pen tests may be requested.
    
- **Committee Approval:** A steering or governance committee (often meeting monthly) reviews the collated docs. Members may request more info or mitigation plans.
    
- **Final Sign-offs:** Once approved, procurement or IT signs contracts (if external AI), and business cases go to finance.
    
- **Deployment & Monitoring:** The model is put into sandbox or prod. Post-launch, use is tracked in an ad-hoc spreadsheet or Slack channel, with no centralized log.
    

In practice, this takes **6–8 weeks** on average per project. Each handoff entails waiting for the next approver to clear calendars or rewrite sections, and documents are sent back and forth on email or SharePoint. Roles are often duplicated (e.g. legal and risk both ask for similar info). Tools: We use Jira tickets and email, plus shared drives for DPIAs and policy documents. No systematic dashboard shows status at a glance. For high-demand tools (like ChatGPT trials), queues form; for custom models, ad hoc security scans are done manually.

Key cycle-time metrics (internal): approximately **5–10 person-days** of work per submission (across all teams), and weeks of calendar delay between steps. The process is tailored per-request rather than standardized, so each new AI tool effectively triggers a bespoke “project.” This approach worked when AI was nascent and rare, but as use-cases grow, the bottleneck is stark: dozens of unmonitored AI initiatives stall or proceed without adequate scrutiny, while executives see slow time‑to‑value.

## 4. Bottlenecks & Risks

The main pain points in our manual process are:

- **Sequential Handovers:** Approvals happen in sequence, not parallel. A request can languish while one group (e.g. legal) wraps up before notifying the next (Risk). Much time is “wait” time.
    
- **Data Collection & Documentation:** Every new AI initiative requires gathering similar info (data sources, model type, affected customers, bias safeguards). People often re-type or hunt for details rather than reusing previous answers.
    
- **Limited Visibility:** Stakeholders (business owners, auditors, compliance) lack real-time views of where a request stands. Delays often stem from not knowing whom to chase or missing meeting opportunities.
    
- **Cognitive Overhead:** Reviewing AI projects manually is error-prone. People may overlook new regulations or make inconsistent risk assessments. Important items (like data privacy) can slip through if the reviewer misses a detail in a long memo.
    
- **False Security:** Relying on infrequent manual reviews breeds false confidence. For example, an offsite consultant might read one page of a DPIA without checking a log’s completeness. In reality, breaches have shown that _intentional or unintentional data misuse can happen if not continuously monitored_.
    

If left unaddressed, these friction points imply serious risks: more extended project delays (slower product launches, lower automation ROI) and amplified compliance risk. We could miss an AI Act documentation deadline, GDPR consent trap (automated profiling without records), or fail DORA continuity tests for an AI-dependent service. Ultimately, the **opportunity cost** – stalled innovation and unhappy customers – is far greater than any automation programme investment.

## 5. Automation Opportunities

We can overhaul each manual step with targeted automation/augmentation, while retaining audit trails. Below is a sketch of key steps and potential solutions:

- **Intake & Triage:**
    
    - _Automation:_ A form-based portal (e.g. ServiceNow or low-code tool) for AI proposals. Guided questions ensure all needed info is collected upfront. Built-in validations (e.g. “Have you included data classification?”) prevent omissions. Initial answers feed into downstream processes.
        
    - _GenAI:_ AI assistants (chatbots) could help draft proposal details or answer policy questions. For instance, an internal “Governance Bot” could suggest whether a DPIA is needed based on use-case text.
        
    - _Risk Control:_ All proposals get logged in a central registry (an “AI use-case inventory”) for tracking (as CredoAI recommends).
        
- **Policy/Risk Review:**
    
    - _Automation:_ Parallel workflows. For example, once intake is done, the system automatically assigns tasks to Legal, Privacy, Security groups simultaneously. Camunda or ServiceNow workflow engines route tasks to responsible people and escalate if delays occur.
        
    - _GenAI:_ ChatGPT plugins in Jira (e.g. GateGPT) could auto-populate risk summaries. For example, the system could draft a draft DPIA or security checklist by scanning the proposal and known controls. Reviewers then only need to edit the draft, not write from scratch.
        
    - _Risk Control:_ The system enforces that certain checkboxes (e.g. “Data classified as personal?”) must be answered; missing answers block progression. We store all reviewer comments in the workflow tool (providing an audit log).
        
- **Compliance Validation:**
    
    - _Automation:_ Automated compliance checks against AI Act/GDPR rule sets. For instance, a rules engine could flag “high-risk category” if the model is LLM used for decision-making, triggering extra review. We could build or buy a policy-automation tool that knows clauses of AI Act/GDPR.
        
    - _GenAI:_ LLM-powered summarizers can map the proposal text to relevant regulations (e.g. “This appears to be a high-risk system under AI Act Annex III”). This ensures nothing is missed. (Tools like ServiceNow Agentic AI do similar compliance summarization.)
        
    - _Risk Control:_ Attach automatically generated report of compliance status to each project record. This becomes evidence for audits.
        
- **Approval & Documentation:**
    
    - _Automation:_ One-click approvals where possible. For example, if risk criteria are “low”, the system auto-approves or fast-tracks. Otherwise, just one leader’s sign-off may suffice. The platform sends notifications to execs for formal signoff, reducing email lag.
        
    - _GenAI:_ During meetings, an AI note-taker could record decisions and tasks. Automated minutes go back into the ticket.
        
    - _Risk Control:_ Every approval (who, when, based on what conditions) is logged. If asked by an auditor or regulator, we can present the entire approval chain in one report.
        
- **Ongoing Monitoring:**
    
    - _Automation:_ Once deployed, connect the model to telemetry. For example, AWS CloudTrail and Bedrock logs can feed into an AI governance dashboard. Any unusual model usage (spikes, data errors) auto-notifies Risk/IT.
        
    - _GenAI:_ Periodically (monthly/quarterly), an AI agent could analyze usage logs against expected patterns and draft alerts (e.g. “Model X usage doubled, exceeding normal threshold”).
        
    - _Risk Control:_ Store logs and summary reports for retention. This satisfies post-market monitoring rules of the AI Act.
        

These automation options (some AI-enabled, some not) would drastically reduce repetitive work. Notably, enterprise tools exist for each purpose: e.g. ServiceNow GRC or Camunda for orchestration, CredoAI or Monitaur for governance dashboards, and AWS Bedrock Logging for model audit trails. Automating compliance document assembly and workflows means **no paper left unturned** – every step is recorded and justifiable, embedding the “by design” compliance regulators expect.

## 6. Peer Benchmarking

Leading peers demonstrate both the **benefit of AI scale** and the **need for governance**:

- **Revolut (Neobank):** Internally, Revolut built an AI-based scam detector for payment requests. By analyzing transaction patterns and using ML, it **cut fraud losses by ~30%**. The tool intercepts suspected scams in real-time. Revolut’s case shows cutting-edge AI can pay off in risk reduction. However, they achieved this by deploying custom in-house ML (not a black-box SaaS) so they could closely audit model behavior – a lesson in control vs. risk.
    
- **bunq (Neobank):** bunq’s AI assistant _Finn_ handles customer support and insights. It now **answers ~40% of inquiries independently**. This frees up human agents and improves response speed. bunq rolled Finn out to millions of users, but emphasizes continuous monitoring: they retrain it to avoid giving poor advice (essentially a lightweight model governance loop). bunq’s path illustrates that front-end GenAI can scale massively **if the backend compliance (data use, logging) is sound**.
    
- **Klarna (Payments/Bank):** Klarna has aggressively built AI into its core. They eliminated 50% of their staff and scrapped ~1200 SaaS tools, moving all infrastructure in-house with AI pivot. While this unlocked huge cost savings and a self-service culture, it also “raised regulatory eyebrows” – EU supervisors are watching how Klarna validates its AI decisions. Klarna’s story is a cautionary tail: going AI-first demands rigorous oversight, exactly the gap our automation would fill.
    
- **NatWest (Retail Bank):** NatWest recently **deployed two GenAI tools to 99% of colleagues**: an internal “AI Digital Enabler” (proprietary LLM tool) and Microsoft Copilot Chat. They rolled this out with heavy emphasis on “secure, controlled environment” and training for compliant use. As NatWest’s CTO noted, doing this “at scale and pace… is a huge feat” (and provides a “launchpad” for further use). Their experience shows a large bank can safely democratize AI – but only by baking in governance (pilot sandboxes, ongoing training, usage monitoring).
    
- **BlackRock (Asset Manager):** BlackRock integrated generative AI into its Aladdin platform (trillions in AUM) with **Aladdin Copilot**. Copilot lets analysts query portfolio data via chat. Crucially, BlackRock stresses “data privacy & risk controls” first: it _won’t answer outside its data scope_, and contains filters to block hallucinations. BlackRock’s case shows how an AI assistant can be “governed by design” – building constraints into the model itself.
    
- **Others:** Many fintechs (Revolut, Starling, etc.) and asset managers (State Street, Bloomberg) are piloting AI with embedded checklists. Meanwhile, startups like **Monitaur** offer model registries/monitoring, and tools like **GateGPT** (Jira plugin) bring LLM assistance to ticket workflows. On the negative side, some firms (e.g. a crypto lender in 2023) got burned by rapid AI rollout without controls, leading to compliance breaches. This underscores our conclusion: scaling AI requires an equally scaled governance process.
    

**Summary of Peers:** Fast movers combine **automation with embedded compliance**. They use GenAI to accelerate tasks (customer support, analysts), but always with audit logs, “off-switches”, and trained teams. Our benchmarking confirms it’s not just about building AI – it’s about **operationalizing governance** in tandem.

## 7. Business Case

**Cost of Inaction:** If we continue with manual approvals, we’ll choke our AI pipeline. Each delayed project delays its ROI. For instance, a fraud-detection AI that saves £1M/year delivers zero benefit if held up 6 months. Long cycle times also mean our engineers spend much more time on compliance tasks (estimated 10–20% of AI project hours), diverting them from core innovation. From a compliance perspective, the stakes are high: regulators worldwide are signaling that manual tick-boxes are insufficient. A slip-up (e.g. failing to update a DPIA) could trigger fines or bans later.

**Investment Required:** Based on analogous automation programmes, we estimate a **£1.6 million** investment over 12 months. This covers: developing the workflow software (or configuring a BPM tool), procuring any governance platform licences (e.g. CredoAI), integrating logs (e.g. AWS/KMS auditing), and 5–8 FTEs of effort (engineering, process design, change management) over one year.

**Value Drivers:** The ROI comes from multiple sources:

- **Efficiency Gains:** Gartner/Macrosoft analysis suggests automation can reduce process costs by _30–50%_. Conservatively, even 30% cycle-time reduction (from ~8 weeks/project to ~5–6 weeks) would free up ~2 employee-months per major AI project. If we process 20 such projects a year, that’s ~40 person-months saved – enough to reassign 3 FTEs out of compliance reviews into revenue-generating development. Valued at, say, £60k salary each, that’s ~£180k/year direct saving on salaries, plus enabling more projects to get done.
    
- **Opportunity Capture:** Faster approvals mean faster innovation. If we accelerate each GenAI use case by 6 months, we can deliver customer-facing features (chatbots, analytics) or back-office automation (KYC, fraud checks) ahead of competitors. Suppose just one major use-case (e.g. automated KYC) goes live 6 months sooner, it could potentially serve thousands more customers and reduce operational costs by a significant fraction. Difficult to quantify precisely, but the real option value is material.
    
- **Risk Avoidance:** By systematizing compliance, we reduce the chance of fines or enforcement actions. UK/UA has precedent for hefty fines for data misuse; the AI Act will add its own penalty regime. Even avoiding a single serious breach (say a GDPR fine on the order of £500k) would justify the automation spend. Additionally, “hidden” risk reduction: audit time spent on manual reviews (~20% of audit efforts) would fall, freeing audit resources.
    
- **Benchmarking Dollars:** For perspective, a peer’s automation tool that handled X process (similar complexity) returned Y% ROI. (E.g. ServiceNow cites customers cutting audit prep from weeks to days). We adapt that evidence to our context.
    

**ROI Projection:** Two models:

- _Conservative:_ 30% process cut → ~£180k/yr efficiency + no fines. Simple payback ~10 yrs (too long), but this ignores growth in projects and secondary benefits (brand, data quality).
    
- _Aggressive:_ 50% cut (achievable with AI-assist) → ~£300k/yr + ability to deploy 50% more projects (estimating £500k additional business value) = ~£800k/yr benefit. Payback ~2 years.
    

Even the conservative case understates indirect gains (improved customer trust, staff morale, innovation culture). Given strategic priorities, a 3–5x ROI over 5 years is plausible.

**Key Metrics:** We will track: cycle time per approval, number of FTEs on approvals, number of AI projects successfully deployed, and any compliance incidents avoided. A dashboard (from the governance platform) will show real-time % of workflows on track vs delayed.

## 8. Delivery Roadmap

We propose a **12-month, phased rollout**:

- **Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Foundations**
    
    - Assemble a cross-functional team (IT architects, data scientists, legal/risk champions, process experts).
        
    - Map the end-to-end manual process in detail (kickoff workshop) and collect sample project data (as we’ve begun).
        
    - Select core tools: e.g. finalize choice of workflow engine (Camunda or ServiceNow GRC) and AI-assistants.
        
    - Develop a pilot approval workflow for a single use case (e.g. new GenAI chat tool): digital intake form + automated routing + audit log.
        
    - Train a small pilot group (1 line of business + risk + IT) and iterate.
        
- **Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Expand & Integrate**
    
    - Refine based on pilot: integrate additional checks (e.g. GDPR DPIA stub, data classification fields).
        
    - Build out parallel channels for “GenAI tool” vs “GenAI use-case” as separate flows (to reflect our current dual-track).
        
    - Incorporate AI helpers: deploy a Chatbot assistant in the workflow tool to summarize text (via API to our chosen LLM).
        
    - Link the system with key repositories: e.g. feed approved AI projects into the model registry; enable AWS CloudTrail/Bedrock logging for any “approved” external AI keys.
        
    - Begin automating some risk scoring: e.g. workflows branch to extra review if certain conditions met (using business rules or a small ML classifier trained on past decisions).
        
- **Phase 3 (Months 7–9): Scale & Embed**
    
    - Roll out the automated workflow to all business units and use-case types (fraud prevention, marketing, etc.), with clear guidance on when to use it.
        
    - Launch a _“Compliance by Design” training_: teach project owners and reviewers how to use the new system (ensuring adoption).
        
    - Automate compliance reporting: build a real-time dashboard on the number of active AI projects, their risk levels, and approval times.
        
    - Implement continuous improvement: regularly review metrics, hold “post-mortems” on workflow glitches, and update the system.
        
- **Phase 4 (Months 10–12): Optimize & Review**
    
    - Enable advanced features: e.g. ServiceNow agentic GRC agents for audit prep, API integrations with AI providers for monitoring.
        
    - Perform a full pilot of a DORA scenario (simulate an AI outage, see if incident response is smooth).
        
    - Calculate final ROI report.
        
    - Plan phase 2 (2026) to cover remaining AI domains (e.g. LLM fine-tuning oversight).
        

**Team & Governance:** A program sponsor (CTO/Head of Data) will steer. Core team: 2 architects/engineers (for tools), 1 data science, 1 compliance lead, 1 project manager, plus 1 FTE legal/risk liaison. We’ll involve external consultants for early design if needed (AI governance expertise is niche). Governance board will meet monthly to unblock issues.

**Success Criteria:** By end of 12 months we must show (a) reduction in average approval time, (b) audit-ready documentation for 100% of approved AI projects, and (c) positive feedback from user surveys (developers and reviewers finding the process easier). We will know we’ve “shifted gears” when new GenAI proposals flow through the system with minimal manual intervention and transparent tracking.

**Funding & ROI Tracking:** The £1.6m budget spans salaries, software licenses, and any pilot costs. We recommend staggering spend: capex for tools upfront, then opex for 2-3 contract FTEs. A simplified dashboard will track budget vs. saved labor cost in real time, reporting to Finance quarterly.

**Sources:** The above is grounded in current EU/UK regulations and our own historical data. Key references include the EU AI Act timeline, FCA’s AI and SM&CR guidance, DORA framework, and industry benchmarks from Revolut, bunq, Klarna, NatWest and BlackRock. Where applicable, statistics on automation ROI support our value estimates. No key information was found to contradict this plan; if new directives (e.g. UK AI Bill) emerge, we will adapt accordingly.
