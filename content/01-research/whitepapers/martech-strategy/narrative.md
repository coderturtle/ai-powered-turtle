Unlocking Growth with Adobe MarTech

## Opening – Why This Matters

Our strategy is anchored in three commitments:

1. **Turn savers into investors**
    
2. **Support people in retirement** with optimal drawdown strategies
    
3. **Bridge the advice gap** to make financial guidance available for all
    

To deliver on these, we must **engage customers with relevance and trust at scale**. Today’s investors expect **personalisation, simplicity, and confidence** across every digital interaction.  
This is exactly where the Adobe Experience stack comes in.

## 🎯 How Adobe Enables Our 3 Pillars

### 1. Turning Savers into Investors

- **Challenge:** Many UK consumers leave money in cash ISAs or current accounts, losing out on long-term returns because they lack confidence in investing.
    
- **Adobe Solution:**
    
    - **Adobe Experience Platform (AEP):** Unifies customer data into a real-time profile (savings behaviour, digital engagement, product holdings).
        
    - **Customer Journey Orchestration (CJO):** Nudges savers with personalised, timely prompts — e.g. _“You could earn X% more by moving from cash to our low-cost investment ISA.”_
        
    - **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM):** Delivers content-rich, mobile-first journeys that educate, simplify investing, and build confidence.
        
- **Outcome:** Higher conversion from saver to investor, with measurable uplift in Net New Money inflows.

| Trust-building education   | Build confidence via content             | **AEM**                       |
| Measurement & optimisation | Track conversion lift                    | **Target, Analytics (later)** |

## 2. Strawman – Adobe Stack Overview

We propose a phased adoption of Adobe MarTech components:

### 🏗 Foundation Components (Core to Success)

- **Adobe Experience Platform (AEP):** The central nervous system. Creates a unified, real-time customer profile by integrating data from apps, CRM, transactions, and digital behaviour.
    
- **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM):** Content hub and delivery engine. Provides consistent, personalised web and mobile experiences.
    
- **Customer Journey Orchestration (CJO):** Decisioning engine. Orchestrates personalised, event-driven journeys across channels (email, app, push, call centre).



### 🔌 Integrate Over Time (Optional/Advanced)

- **Adobe Target:** Testing and optimisation platform for personalisation at scale.
    
- **Adobe Analytics:** Deeper insight into engagement and conversion.
    
- **Adobe Journey Optimizer AI/RT-CDP extensions:** Predictive recommendations, next best action.
    
- **Marketo Engage:** If we later expand into B2B distribution and adviser enablement.
    

This distinction makes clear: we don’t need everything on day one. We start with a **foundation stack** and expand as our capabilities and customer needs mature.
### 2. Supporting Retirement & Drawdown

- **Challenge:** Retirees face complex decisions: when and how to draw down, balancing income and lifestyle with longevity risk. Poor choices erode trust and financial wellbeing.
    
- **Adobe Solution:**
    
    - **AEP:** Combines customer data with actuarial and product insights to create segments (e.g. those approaching retirement, those in early drawdown).
        
    - **CJO:** Triggers proactive, personalised guidance at the right life moment — e.g. _“You are approaching retirement, here are your drawdown options with modelled income projections.”_
        
    - **AEM:** Serves accessible tools, explainer videos, and calculators dynamically tailored to each customer.
        
- **Outcome:** Better retirement decisions, improved customer satisfaction, reduced attrition to competitors, and alignment with FCA Consumer Duty.
    
|Capability Needed|Why it Matters|Adobe Enabler|
|---|---|---|
|Life-stage segmentation|Tailor support for pre- vs in-retirement|**AEP**|
|Timely guidance|Engage customers approaching drawdown|**CJO**|
|Accessible digital tools|Help customers model drawdown options|**AEM**|
|AI insights|Predict at-risk retirees for proactive outreach|**AI extensions (later)**|

### 3. Bridging the Advice Gap

- **Challenge:** Traditional advice is costly and inaccessible for smaller investors. But digital-first customers expect support that feels personal, even without a human adviser.
    
- **Adobe Solution:**
    
    - **AEP:** Creates holistic profiles across demographics, behaviours, and goals.
        
    - **CJO:** Orchestrates hybrid “advice-lite” experiences — e.g. guided pathways for first-time investors, automated reminders for portfolio rebalancing.
        
    - **AEM:** Powers a digital advice hub with content and tools that flex to the individual’s level of knowledge and confidence.
        
- **Outcome:** Democratise access to advice, grow our addressable market, and deepen engagement across all wealth tiers.
    
|Capability Needed|Why it Matters|Adobe Enabler|
|---|---|---|
|Democratised advice|Deliver “advice-lite” journeys at scale|**CJO + AEM**|
|Knowledge-based content|Simplify investing concepts|**AEM**|
|Hybrid support|Blend digital + adviser handoff|**AEP + CJO**|
