## The short version
- **Problem:** International (EU/CA/AU) gets AI features N+1; EU AI Act and data residency slow delivery; Backstage isn’t the on-ramp it should be.
- **Move:** Stand up **Project Loom**—a small **AI Enablement CoE** that ships **paved roads** (Gateway Blueprint, Evidence Assistant, Patterns Library, and a rebooted **Loom Portal**).
- **How:** Work like an **incubation lab**—ship exemplars, keep guardrails in code, and run **Rotation Pods** so engineers learn by doing.
- **Outcome (2026):** Time‑to‑pilot ↓50%, intl‑ready at GA ≥80%, compliance lead‑time ↓40%.
