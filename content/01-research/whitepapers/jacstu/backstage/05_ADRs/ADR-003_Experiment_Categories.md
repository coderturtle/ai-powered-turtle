# ADR-003: Experiment categories

Date: 18 Oct 2025 • Status: Accepted

## Decision
Use three categories:
- Workflow & Stack
- Role Evolution
- Team Topology

Keep them separate from impact dimensions (Team, Clients, Process). Add category to dashboards and labels.

## Consequences
- Clear “what changed” vs “where the benefit landed”.
- Enables staged learning (workflow → role → team).
