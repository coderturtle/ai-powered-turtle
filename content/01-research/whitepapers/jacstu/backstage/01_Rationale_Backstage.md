# Why Backstage

Backstage gives us a simple way to **coordinate across regions** without adding a new platform. It already hosts our catalogue, ownership, and docs. We add a small plugin and templates; teams keep using GitHub and their usual tools.

**Reasons**
- One catalogue for experiments and owners (clear accountability).
- Scaffolder to create a standardised experiment folder with PRFAQ and baselines.
- TechDocs to publish playbooks so guidance sits next to the work.
- Scorecards (Tech Insights) to enforce basics: baseline present, three measures, comparison posted.
- Lightweight to run; no separate portal per region.

**Scope**
- EU first (Personal Investing; Advisor Services).
- Global visibility; local ownership.
- Keep governance in existing routes (no new approval gates).
