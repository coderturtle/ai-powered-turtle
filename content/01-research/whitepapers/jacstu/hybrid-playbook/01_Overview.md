# Overview

This playbook standardises how we propose, run and evaluate **hybrid human+agent experiments**. It separates:
- **Experiment types** (what we change): Workflow & Stack 路 Role Evolution 路 Team Topology.
- **Impact pillars** (where results appear): Team 路 Clients 路 Process.

Each experiment is a short **PRFAQ** with a baseline up front and three measures. We publish percentage deltas against the baseline using the same metric definitions across teams.
