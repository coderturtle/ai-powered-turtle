# Dashboard guide

**Files**
- `hybrid-experiments/baselines.csv`
- `hybrid-experiments/dashboard.csv`

**Comparison row fields**
`experiment_id, owner, framework, category, metric, delta_pct, composite_score, tags, last_updated`

**Reading the table**
- Look at raw pillar deltas first.
- Composite score is optional; it helps leadership compare, but should not hide detail.
