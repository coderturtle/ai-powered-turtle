# FAQ

**Is this extra process?**  
One page to start and a baseline row. Dashboards update on push.

**Will this slow teams down?**  
No. We measure while shipping; baselines are collected in week one.

**What if metrics can’t be instrumented?**  
Use a time‑study and mark confidence in the record.

**How do we keep language grounded?**  
Plain English; no buzzwords; show dates and sources.
