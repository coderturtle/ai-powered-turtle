title: Baselines & Comparison
---

# Baselines & comparison

> Baseline first; then publish percentage change using the same definitions across teams.

## Baseline rules
- Capture data for the exact workflow in scope, before change.
- Use shared metric definitions.
- Record context (team size, domain, region, tools).

**Baseline fields**
`experiment_id, category, metric, baseline_value, date_collected, data_source, team_size, domain`

## Comparison rules
- Report **Î”% vs baseline** for each pillar.
- Keep the **category** separate from the impact measures.
- Optional composite view for leadership; raw measures remain primary.
