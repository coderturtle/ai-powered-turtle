# Style Guide

Use | Avoid
---|---
use, measure, reduce, decide | leverage, unlock, transformative
plan, schedule | roadmap (unless program-level)
controls | guardrails (unless policy term)
findings | learnings

Spelling: organise, prioritise, behaviour, programme  
Tone: plain English; short sentences; dates and sources; no emojis in headings.

## Rewrite examples
- “Leverage AI to unlock value” → “Use approved agents for routine work and measure the change in lead time and error rate.”
- “Transformative roadmap” → “Plan for the next two quarters.”
