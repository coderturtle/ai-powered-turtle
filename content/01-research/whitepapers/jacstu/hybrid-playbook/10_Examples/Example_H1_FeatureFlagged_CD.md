# Example — H1: Feature‑Flagged Continuous Delivery (Workflow & Stack)

## Press note
Enable feature‑flagged CD with evaluation checks for EU onboarding. Aim: shorter lead time without higher change‑fail.

## Baseline
Lead time 10.8 days; deploy freq 1.3/week; change‑fail 7.2%; automation 42% (Jan–Feb; Jira/GitHub/Ops).

## Measures
- Lead time — 10.8 → 8.5 days by 30 Jun.
- Change‑fail — ≤ 7.2% (no worse).
- Automation coverage — 42% → 60% by 30 Jun.
