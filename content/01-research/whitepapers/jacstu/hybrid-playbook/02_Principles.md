# Principles

1. **Small and real.** Ship to real users behind flags; avoid paper plans.
2. **Baseline first.** Record where we are before change.
3. **Three measures only.** Enough to decide; not a dashboard farm.
4. **Category ≠ Impact.** Be clear on the lever vs the outcome.
5. **Safety by default.** Use standard pipeline and policy checks.
6. **Prove then promote.** Scale only when results hold and risks are managed.
7. **Plain English.** Avoid buzzwords; write for non‑technical colleagues.
