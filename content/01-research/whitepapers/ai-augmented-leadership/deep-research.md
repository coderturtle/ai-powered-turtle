# **AI-Augmented Leadership: Automating Executive Tasks with Modern Tools**

As a senior architecture and platform engineering manager aiming for executive leadership, you can leverage AI to drastically reduce the cognitive load of routine administrative, operational, and communication tasks. Recent studies show that 70% of employees are willing to delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen workloads – a trend forward-looking leaders should capitalize on. The following report details the **art of the possible** with today’s AI tools, maps core leadership responsibilities to AI-augmented use cases, and provides a phased plan to implement these solutions. It also highlights key skills to develop on your journey to becoming an “AI-first” executive, ensuring you maintain high visibility and influence across stakeholders.

## **Landscape of AI Tools for Leadership Automation**

Modern AI assistants can act as “co-pilots” in nearly every facet of a leader’s workflow. Below is an overview of the toolchain available in your enterprise environment and how each can automate or augment leadership tasks:

### **Microsoft 365 Copilot Suite** (Outlook, Teams, Word, Loop, Planner, Viva)

Microsoft 365 Copilot integrates GPT-4-based intelligence across the Office suite, allowing you to delegate drafting, summarizing, and insight-mining work to an AI assistant. For example, **Copilot in Outlook** can instantly summarize long email threads and even draft responses or newsletter content based on key points – saving time in managing your inbox. **Copilot in Teams** can recap chat conversations and meetings, organize key discussion points, and summarize action items, even drafting follow-up messages in the appropriate tone. It essentially serves as an autonomous meeting scribe and communication coach. In **Word**, Copilot helps generate first drafts of documents and then refine them – suggesting ways to strengthen your arguments, smooth inconsistencies, or strike the right tone. Copilot can even take a simple prompt or outline and produce a polished document or presentation, pulling in relevant data from your files to ensure accuracy. With **PowerPoint Copilot**, for instance, you can provide a written report and it will generate a slide deck with appropriate branding and speaker notes. **Copilot in Loop** (Microsoft’s collaborative canvas app) allows your team to co-create content live with the AI – e.g. brainstorming project plans, generating tables or lists, and summarizing page content so everyone stays in sync. Even in Planner and Viva, Copilot is poised to streamline routine managerial processes: for example, automatically turning meeting outcomes into Planner tasks or helping draft engaging posts in Viva Engage. (Microsoft’s internal “Customer Zero” deployment has shown rapid adoption of Copilot, as employees embrace delegating busywork to AI.) Notably, Microsoft is also rolling out **Copilot Studio**, enabling you to build custom _agents_ that connect to organizational data and execute processes on your behalf. In essence, the M365 Copilot suite acts as an **AI executive assistant**, handling everything from summarizing data to drafting communications, while respecting enterprise security and compliance policies.

### **GitHub Copilot and Agentic Workflows**

GitHub Copilot extends AI assistance into software development and scripting domains. While initially an “AI pair programmer,” Copilot’s capabilities now include **summarization and multi-step automation** in code – features highly relevant even for a leader who needs to process technical information or automate team workflows. For instance, Copilot can **summarize code changes** in a pull request or explain code in plain language, which can help you quickly grasp the impact of engineering work without digging through every line. It also shines in generating utilities and scripts: _“GitHub Copilot can generate scripts to automate…operations,”_ from file management to API calls. This means if you can describe a repetitive task (e.g. aggregating data from logs, formatting a report, converting files) in natural language, Copilot will produce the script or code to do it, which you or your team can then run. Copilot supports a range of languages and environments (Python, Bash, PowerShell, AppleScript, etc.), enabling automation across your systems. Engineers at GitHub report that Copilot _“increases efficiency…by allowing us to automate repetitive tasks, stay focused, and more.”_ In its latest evolution, **Copilot’s Agent mode** introduces an autonomous AI agent that can carry out multi-step tasks with minimal supervision. In this mode, Copilot becomes _“an autonomous, agentic real-time collaborator that performs multi-step coding tasks based on natural-language prompts… understanding your intent, building a solution, and iterating until it gets it right.”_ Rather than just suggest code, it can plan and execute a series of actions (editing multiple files, running tests/commands, integrating with APIs) to fulfill a goal you give it. While primarily geared toward software tasks, this _agentic workflow_ can be repurposed for leadership needs – for example, automating data analysis or generating custom tools. In short, GitHub Copilot can serve as your **automation engine**, letting you script away tedious tasks and even delegating complex problem-solving to an AI “agent” that works asynchronously on your behalf.

### **“Writer” AI Assistant for Communications and Narratives**

Writer (an enterprise AI writing assistant) is a tool designed to elevate the quality, consistency, and efficiency of your written communications. It functions as an AI editor and ghostwriter that understands your company’s terminology and style guides. Leaders often spend significant time drafting newsletters, strategy memos, or policy documents – but Writer can generate a solid first draft for these, which you then lightly edit. For example, the marketing team at Ivanti used Writer to accelerate content creation and found that it freed them to focus on strategic work instead of writing from scratch. _“Thanks to Writer, their team can focus on strategic processes instead of spending time writing content from scratch.”_ This applies equally to internal comms – imagine having an AI draft your weekly update email or project proposal in your established tone. Writer learns your **brand voice** and terminology by training on your provided content. It will enforce your editorial rules (terminology, phrasing, preferred style) across all your writing: _“By correcting off-brand tone and suggesting more appropriate language, an AI writing assistant helps teams execute consistent voice and style.”_. It also handles mundane edits: grammar, conciseness, converting passive to active voice, etc., improving clarity and impact. In practice, you might use Copilot to produce a first draft of an announcement, then run it through Writer to refine phrasing to company style and simplify any confusing sections. Writer’s generative capabilities can shorten text or expand bullet points as needed, and you maintain full control over the tone and final output. The result is **polished communications in a fraction of the time**. By automating the drudgery of editing and aligning to style guides, Writer helps you craft compelling narratives (whether a project vision doc or an email to the CIO) that are both on-brand and engaging. This not only saves time but ensures your messaging consistently reinforces your leadership **storytelling** and the team’s “brand” within the company.

### **Mac Automation Tools (Shortcuts, Raycast, Alfred, AppleScript)**

In your Mac-centric workflow, native automation can streamline the _glue_ between applications and daily routines. **Apple Shortcuts** (built into macOS) lets you create custom macros that tie together multiple apps or steps – and you can trigger them with a click or at scheduled times. _“By letting you automate frequent or cumbersome tasks, Shortcuts has become a productivity favorite…”_ on Mac, iPhone, and iPad, enabling you to offload things like file organization, setting up focus time, or sending routine messages. For example, you could create a Shortcut that every Friday: compiles key calendar events and Teams messages of the week, summarizes them (via a Copilot or API call), and drafts an email update for you. **AppleScript** offers deeper control, allowing automation in any scriptable app (e.g. Outlook, Teams, Excel). With AppleScript you can do things like extract data from an email and populate a Task list, or generate a slide deck from a template. While AppleScript scripting is laborious by hand, GitHub Copilot can write it for you – effectively you describe the desired workflow, and Copilot produces the AppleScript code to execute it. This unlocks powerful custom automation: _“AppleScript allows you to control scriptable applications… to automate processes that are repetitive, tedious and error prone.”_ Indeed, Apple’s Terminal user guide notes you _“can use AppleScript… to save time or automate repetitive tasks.”_. Tools like **Alfred** and **Raycast** act as productivity hubs on Mac. Alfred’s workflows can launch sequences of actions with a simple hotkey, and Raycast goes a step further with AI integration. **Raycast’s AI** features let you use natural language to command your Mac: _“AI Extensions turn your everyday language into actions – from renaming files to checking tickets.”_. For instance, you can hit a shortcut and say “schedule a 30-min focus block on my calendar this afternoon” or “move all PDFs from Downloads to Project X folder,” and Raycast will interpret and execute it. It essentially combines macOS scripting with GPT’s understanding of your intent. By configuring Raycast and Alfred with relevant extensions (e.g. controlling Apple Mail, Things or Reminders, opening specific documents), you gain a **personal command center** – many small administrative clicks and navigations can be done with one or two keystrokes or a single typed command. In summary, Mac automation tools will support your AI workflows by handling the “last mile” of integration – whether it’s launching the right apps, moving data between them, or triggering AI prompts at set times – thereby **automating your leadership rituals** on the device level.

### **Prompting Workflows for Decision-Making and Journaling**

Beyond formal tools, one of the most powerful ways to leverage AI is by using **prompting techniques** to support personal productivity, strategic thinking, and self-reflection. In effect, you can use an AI (like ChatGPT or Copilot Chat) as a **thought partner** and coach. Forward-looking leaders are already using ChatGPT to improve “soft” leadership skills: _“Team leaders are using [AI] to transform team management – giving clarity, supercharging decision-making, and even streamlining conflict resolution.”_ For example, you can prompt an AI to help weigh a complex decision, brainstorm solutions to a team challenge, or role-play a difficult conversation. AI excels at offering **neutral, data-driven perspectives** that you might not have considered, helping you make more informed and confident decisions. It can also assist with communication tone – e.g. you might paste a draft announcement and ask, “Does this message convey optimism and clarity?” to get iterative feedback. A particularly effective practice is **AI-augmented journaling**. After important meetings or at day’s end, you can feed your notes or thoughts to an AI and prompt it to identify patterns or ask you probing questions. Consider maintaining a “leadership diary” in OneNote or Obsidian, and periodically running an AI analysis on it. One real-world example: a manager collected three months of one-on-one meeting notes and gave them to an AI with the prompt to _“Identify patterns, potential issues, and topics that repeatedly arise. What am I missing? What questions should I be asking?”_. The AI surfaced consistent themes (e.g. team members needing clearer priorities, or multiple people interested in mentoring opportunities) that the manager hadn’t fully recognized. It even suggested follow-up questions the leader could pose to dig deeper. This kind of insight acts like a mirror, revealing blind spots in team morale or dynamics. You can similarly use prompting for **decision logs** – e.g. summarizing why a major decision was made and asking the AI, “How might stakeholders perceive this rationale, and how should I communicate it for transparency?” An AI can critique your reasoning and propose more persuasive or empathetic messaging. Overall, building a personal workflow of regularly **consulting AI for reflection** – whether through daily Q&A journaling prompts, end-of-week decision reviews, or pre-meeting strategy checks – will enhance your self-awareness and decision quality. It’s like having a diligent executive coach on call 24/7, one that helps you think through problems methodically and keeps a memory of your past context for continuity.

## **Catalog of AI-Augmented Leadership Rituals**

Many of your core leadership responsibilities can be elevated by these AI tools and techniques. Below is a catalog mapping key leadership tasks (“rituals”) to AI-augmented use cases and solutions:

- **Weekly Updates & Newsletters:** _Automate the creation of weekly team updates._ Use Copilot in Outlook or Word to generate a first draft of your weekly newsletter email by pulling in highlights from your calendar, project trackers, and emails. For example, you might prompt, _“Summarize this week’s key achievements and challenges from my team’s emails and meetings, in 5 bullet points.”_ Copilot can reference your recent communications to produce a succinct summary. You can then have Writer refine the tone and clarity, ensuring the update is engaging and on-brand (e.g. simplifying jargon, adding an uplifting intro). Microsoft’s own adoption guides demonstrate this workflow: summarizing relevant emails, drafting an announcement post, then refining the draft’s style in Word. The result is a polished weekly update or internal blog post that took you minutes, not hours, to produce. You remain **visible to stakeholders** through consistent, high-quality updates, while AI does the heavy lifting of compiling the content.
    
- **Meeting Preparation & Post-Meeting Summaries:** _Never walk into a meeting cold or leave without clear takeaways._ AI can serve as your meeting aide at each stage. Before meetings, use Copilot to **prep context**: ask Teams Copilot, _“What decisions were made in the last meeting with [Client/Team]?”_ and it will recap previous minutes and key points. Copilot in Loop or OneNote can gather relevant files or discussion threads into a brief. After the meeting, Teams can automatically generate a summary of the discussion and list of action items (with who’s responsible). In fact, with Teams Premium and Copilot enabled, you have an **AI notetaker** that can produce meeting minutes and even suggest next steps. You could also instruct Copilot (or a Power Automate flow) to post the summary to a Teams channel for those who missed it, and create follow-up tasks in Planner. Even if full automation of task creation isn’t live yet, Copilot will at least extract the tasks and decisions, which you or your assistant can confirm and assign. This dramatically reduces the burden of manual note-taking and ensures _nothing falls through the cracks_. It also helps in **meeting follow-through**: you can quickly share AI-curated summaries with attendees, and use Outlook Copilot to draft thank-you or follow-up emails highlighting the decisions made. Over time, these AI-generated records build into a knowledge base you can query (e.g. “Copilot, when was Project X first proposed and by whom?”). Ultimately, AI augmentation for meetings frees you to focus on the discussion _in the moment_, while still producing thorough documentation and follow-ups afterward.
    
- **Stakeholder Memory and Context Capture:** _Build an “AI CRM” for your key stakeholders._ Effective leaders cultivate context about each stakeholder – their goals, preferences, and history of interactions – but this is cognitively demanding. AI can help maintain and recall this _stakeholder memory_. For instance, you might keep a OneNote section or Loop page per key stakeholder where you jot notes from each interaction. Copilot in Loop can then **summarize a stakeholder’s page** on demand, giving you a brief on that person: _“Summarize Jane’s key concerns, recent asks, and any personal notes from our meetings in the last 6 months.”_ The AI could output something like, “Jane (CFO) is focused on cost savings this quarter and has asked your team to improve cloud cost efficiency. She responded positively to the last architecture demo. She values concise updates and prefers data-backed proposals.” This kind of summary ensures you walk into every conversation with full context, even if you haven’t spoken to someone in a while. Additionally, you can use **Copilot’s Chat** connected to your communications: ask, _“What were the outcomes of my last 1:1 with John Doe?”_, and it can retrieve and summarize the email you sent him afterward or the notes you took. Microsoft’s Work Trend Index emphasizes leveraging AI for such recall: these AI “agents” can fetch instant answers from internal data – _“on-demand intelligence”_ for queries across meetings, emails, and documents. Moreover, AI can help with **stakeholder follow-up** and influence tracking: for example, using Viva Insights or a custom Copilot agent, you could get nudges like “It’s been 30 days since you last updated the CTO on Project Y” or “Schedule a coffee chat with your new engineering manager this month.” Viva is introducing AI-powered **nudges** exactly for this – personalized reminders for managers to connect with employees regularly. By automating the capture and recall of stakeholder context, you develop a richer understanding of your network without relying on memory alone. This leads to more personalized and influential interactions, as you can tailor your communications with AI-curated insights (e.g. referencing a detail AI helped you remember about a stakeholder’s priority).
    
- **Performance Tracking Dashboards & Analytics:** _Use AI to monitor and narrate team performance._ You likely review many metrics – project delivery status, system uptime, budget vs. actuals, team OKR progress – often via various dashboards (Excel, Power BI, etc.). AI can act as an interpreter of these metrics, surfacing insights and suggesting narrative. For instance, **Copilot in Excel** can analyze a raw data table or pivot chart and tell you the key trends in plain English. _“Copilot in Excel…extracts key insights and trends so you can act on data more effectively.”_ If you have a performance dashboard spreadsheet, you could prompt, _“Copilot, what are the notable changes this month in the team’s KPIs? Summarize any anomalies.”_ It might respond, “This month, Project A is 10% ahead of schedule, and customer satisfaction for Product X improved from 85 to 92. However, on-call response time increased by 5 hours, indicating a potential issue in support coverage.” You can further ask Copilot to draft a short **report or email** based on these insights – effectively generating a narrative around the numbers. Additionally, consider building a custom “executive dashboard assistant” agent (using Copilot Studio or Power Platform) that can pull data from multiple systems (Jira, CI/CD pipeline, financials) and aggregate it. Instead of manually checking each source, you ask a question in natural language and the agent returns a synthesized answer with citations or charts. This approach was hinted at by Microsoft’s vision of agents that can connect to external business applications to answer questions and execute tasks. Beyond just reporting, AI can help with **performance reviews**: e.g. feeding it data on an employee’s contributions and getting a draft performance summary, or identifying patterns from 1:1 notes (as described earlier) to provide developmental feedback. The key benefit is that AI continuously watches the data and can call out noteworthy events or trends, ensuring you’re quickly aware of issues and successes. By automating the analysis and first-draft reporting, you maintain a high-level _situational awareness_ of team performance without drowning in spreadsheets – and you can proactively address problems or recognize achievements with timely insights.
    
- **Team Marketing (Internal & External Storytelling):** _Showcase your team’s work using AI-assisted storytelling._ Promoting your team’s accomplishments is crucial for influence – be it via internal newsletters, Yammer/Viva Engage posts, or external blogs and conference talks. AI tools can dramatically speed up content creation in this realm. For internal marketing, you can leverage Copilot and Writer together: Copilot to gather the factual content and draft the narrative, Writer to ensure it’s punchy and aligns with company tone. For example, after finishing a major project, you might prompt Copilot Chat, _“Outline a success story for Project Zephyr, highlighting the problem, our solution, and the impact (with metrics).”_ The AI could produce an outline or even a full story which you then refine. Microsoft 365 Copilot can even pull from relevant files (design docs, slide decks, emails) to enrich the story with accurate details. In one Copilot scenario, a user asked for an “awareness post” about a new tool and Copilot drafted it using data from emails and research, then was instructed to generate a few variations and a fun intro – a process that can be applied to marketing your team’s innovations. For external content like blog posts or conference proposals, AI can help tailor the message to different audiences. _Generative AI allows for rapid, hyper-personalized content creation,_ as noted in industry use cases. You could maintain a library of AI prompt templates for common content types (e.g. “Case study write-up”, “Tech blog tutorial”) to ensure consistency. Furthermore, Copilot in PowerPoint is a boon for creating **executive-level presentations** about your team: give it a prompt like _“Create a 5-slide overview of Team X’s accomplishments in Q3, with one slide per key project, including one chart showing results”_ – it will draft a slide deck with proper structure, which you can then refine visually. By integrating AI into your team marketing “ritual,” you ensure that your team’s value is consistently communicated across the organization and beyond, without overloading your schedule. The AI handles the initial grind of content creation; you add the strategic polish. This boosts your internal influence (others hear about your team’s wins more often) and also establishes you as a thought leader in broader circles if you share AI-crafted articles externally.
    
- **Career Development Tracking and Nudges:** _Never miss a beat in growing your people._ As a leader, coaching and developing your team is a top priority, but keeping track of each person’s goals, feedback, and growth areas can be challenging. AI can function like a personal HR assistant, helping you track development plans and prompting you with “nudges” to support your team. Microsoft Viva Insights, for instance, can send managers regular coaching emails and reminders for check-ins, using AI to flag when an employee might be overdue for feedback or recognition. You can augment this with your own custom prompts. Imagine maintaining a simple table of each team member’s development goals, last one-on-one date, and any promised actions (like “find a mentor for Sarah” or “send John to that AWS training”). You could ask an AI agent weekly, _“Review my team development log and tell me: who haven’t I given feedback to recently? Who might need a new challenge or a follow-up on their goal?”_ The AI might reply, “You haven’t had a dedicated growth conversation with Alice in 6 weeks. She completed her Kubernetes training last month – consider discussing how she can apply it. Also, Bob expressed interest in leadership training 3 months ago; suggest a next step.” These kinds of AI-generated nudges ensure **no one’s growth falls through the cracks**. Furthermore, AI can help generate individualized content: for example, drafting a congratulatory note when someone hits an achievement (you provide a few specifics, the AI composes a warm message), or even helping tailor how you deliver feedback by analyzing what style resonates with that individual (perhaps using sentiment analysis on past communications). The **performance log analysis** described earlier is also relevant here – identifying patterns in an employee’s feedback over time. By integrating AI into your regular one-on-one and talent review process, you effectively get a second pair of eyes (and memory) on everyone’s progression. This not only improves team morale (because each member feels seen and supported at the right times), but it also builds your reputation as a leader who is _highly attentive and proactive_ about talent development, accomplished with the behind-the-scenes help of AI.
    

## **Toolchain and Setup Recommendations**

To implement the above use cases, it’s critical to configure your AI toolchain properly, especially on Microsoft 365 and macOS. Here are the recommended tool setups and configurations for a smooth start:

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot Access:** Ensure you have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license enabled on your account (this is an add-on to E3/E5 plans). Work with IT to activate Copilot across Outlook, Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote for your user. Once enabled, Copilot typically appears as an assistant or chat interface within these apps. For example, in Outlook you’ll see a Copilot side pane where you can type prompts like “Summarize these emails.” In Teams, Copilot is available in meeting sidebars and chat compose boxes for drafting or Q&A. **Configure data access**: Since Copilot works with your Microsoft Graph data, verify you have access to all relevant SharePoint sites, Teams channels, and mailboxes – Copilot can only draw from content you have permission to see. Initial rollout experience from Microsoft’s internal adoption suggests focusing on a few key scenarios first (email draft, meeting summary) to get comfortable. Familiarize yourself with the **Copilot Prompt Gallery**, which offers example prompts within each app. This is a built-in library to inspire you and can be a good training tool as you start out.
    
- **GitHub Copilot Setup:** If you haven’t already, install the GitHub Copilot extension in your code editor (VS Code, for instance) and sign in with your GitHub Enterprise account. In settings, enable **Copilot for multiline completions** and the **Copilot chat/agent** features (if your enterprise has enabled the preview). This gives you a chat sidebar where you can type requests (not just accept inline code suggestions). For your needs, also install the **GitHub Copilot CLI** tool if available – it lets you get command-line suggestions and even explanations of shell commands, which can aid in automating scripts. Configure any organization allow-lists if needed for using Copilot with certain repositories (to respect code security policies). Finally, bookmark the documentation on **Copilot’s new agent mode** so you can experiment with giving it higher-level tasks in a sandbox repository. A simple test could be: “Write a Python script that reads an Excel file of project data and outputs a summary of each project’s status,” and see Copilot agent plan and execute it. By having Copilot ready in your dev environment, you equip yourself to swiftly translate any repetitive manual process into code automation with minimal friction.
    
- **Writer Integration:** Get access to your enterprise’s Writer instance (ensure your account is set up with the relevant style guides/terminology loaded). Writer offers plugins for popular platforms; for example, if you use Microsoft Word or Outlook via a browser, the Writer Chrome extension can provide real-time suggestions. If available, enable the **Writer for Office** add-in so you can use it directly in Word for live editing. Configure Writer with your team’s custom dictionary – e.g. product names, internal acronyms – so that it doesn’t flag those and even suggests them appropriately. Spend some time exploring Writer’s **templates/snippets** feature: you can create reusable templates for common communications (like a weekly report format or project proposal outline) and let Writer auto-fill or adapt them. Essentially, set up a “content style guide” within Writer (many enterprises pre-load their brand voice guidelines). The payoff is that when you or anyone on your team writes, the AI will ensure consistency. Encourage your team to also use Writer for their communications; as a leader you might even share a **custom Writer style** with them (to uniformly represent your department’s voice). In summary, integrate Writer into your writing workflow so that it’s always a click away when you draft in email or docs – it should become second nature to hit the Writer suggestions button for any important announcement or narrative piece.
    
- **Mac Automation Toolkit:** On your Mac, install and configure the following: **Raycast** (consider subscribing to Raycast Pro for full AI capabilities and cloud sync). In Raycast, log in and enable the **AI Commands** feature, which includes a set of built-in natural language actions (see examples in the Raycast manual). Test a few out-of-the-box ones such as “Move files” or “Add to calendar” via the Raycast prompt to get comfortable. Next, install relevant **Raycast extensions** for your workflow – e.g. an Outlook extension (or Apple Mail), a Teams extension (if available), Apple Calendar, Reminders, and any dev tools you use. Raycast’s store has many scripts; pick those that align with tasks you identified (like quickly starting Zoom meetings, creating Todoist tasks, etc.). For **Apple Shortcuts**, open the Shortcuts app and browse the **Gallery** for any pre-built shortcuts that might be useful (e.g. “Email me a summary of my day” or “Prepare for meeting”). Many user-submitted shortcuts can integrate with Calendar, Mail, and so on. Also import any Automator workflows you might have used into Shortcuts (macOS can convert them). Create at least one or two custom shortcuts to serve your AI workflows: for instance, _“Daily Reflection”_ – a shortcut that at 5 PM gathers your day’s meetings and asks Copilot (via an API or AppleScript that sends a query to ChatGPT) to generate a brief journal entry or list of to-dos. Such a shortcut can even prompt you interactively for input (e.g. “What was your biggest win today?”) and then concatenate the info and send it to your journal. Lastly, enable the **Screen Time API** and other automation permissions as needed (some scripts may require accessibility permissions to control apps). If you use Alfred, ensure it’s set to a hotkey that doesn’t conflict with Raycast (many prefer Raycast for its modern AI features, but Alfred’s advanced workflows might still be useful for purely local tasks). Consider an Alfred workflow that triggers an AppleScript to open all relevant apps and documents for your Monday morning planning (one command to launch Outlook, Teams, your planning OneNote, and perhaps run a Copilot summary of new emails). In short, tailor your Mac automation environment so that common actions and your AI-assisted routines are one keystroke away – this investment in setup will pay off with dozens of micro-efficiencies every day.
    
- **Security & Privacy Settings:** Given you’re in an enterprise environment, ensure all these tools comply with internal policies. Microsoft 365 Copilot data stays within your tenant boundaries, so that should be IT-approved. For GitHub Copilot, verify with legal/IT if using it on proprietary code is allowed under GitHub’s terms (Copilot has an enterprise version that avoids public data retention). With Writer, your company likely hosts a dedicated instance, but confirm that any data you feed it (like confidential draft content) is covered under your enterprise agreement. On the Mac automation side, be mindful if you connect any AI that uses cloud APIs (e.g. Raycast AI uses OpenAI on the backend) – avoid sending highly sensitive text unless approved. Utilize features like **Copilot’s Copyright Commitment** (which protects you from IP claims on Copilot output) when using generated content publicly. Essentially, configure settings to balance productivity with compliance: e.g. turn off Copilot in any document libraries that contain regulated data, or use data classification (Purview) to prevent Copilot from accessing certain files. It’s worth having a discussion with IT security on guidelines for AI usage – by proactively addressing this, you also position yourself as a thought leader guiding safe AI adoption.
    

## **Phased Experimentation and Implementation Plan**

Implementing AI augmentation is best approached iteratively. Below is a phased plan to experiment, pilot, and scale these workflows, along with feedback loops for tuning:

1. **Phase 1 – Personal Pilot (Weeks 1–4):** _Start small with your own workflow to build confidence and quick wins._ In this phase, configure your core tools and try 2–3 pilot workflows solo. **Tool setup:** Complete the tool configurations above – enable Copilot in M365 apps, set up Writer, and install Mac automation tools. Make sure to also **organize your data** (for example, have your meeting notes in a consistent place, ensure your calendar is up to date) so the AI has quality input. **Pilot workflows:** Choose a handful of high-value, low-risk tasks to automate. For instance: (a) Use Teams Copilot to generate **post-meeting summaries** for one recurring meeting you host, and share these summaries with attendees. (b) Use Outlook Copilot (and Writer) to draft your **next weekly newsletter** – you provide some bullet points of content, let AI expand it, then you edit and send. (c) Begin a **daily journaling routine**: each afternoon, spend 10 minutes with a Copilot Chat (or ChatGPT) prompt to reflect on the day (you could use a prompt like _“Briefly list today’s key accomplishments, any blockers, and one insight for improvement”_ and log the result). **Iteration and feedback:** Document what’s working and any friction. For example, you might find Copilot’s meeting summary missed a decision – note that, and consider if your prompt needs tweaking (maybe ask Copilot explicitly, _“List any decisions made and actions assigned.”_). At this stage, gather **personal metrics**: time spent on the task before vs. after, quality improvements, etc. Even subjective feedback is fine (e.g. “newsletter drafting took 30 minutes instead of 2 hours, and got positive feedback from readers on clarity”). Use a section in your OneNote to jot these observations. If some pilot isn’t delivering value, adjust it or put it aside; focus on the ones that show promise. By the end of Phase 1, you should have a couple of AI-augmented rituals that feel natural and beneficial. Additionally, address any setup kinks (maybe you discover you need a better microphone for dictating to Copilot, or to request access to a preview feature from IT). **Success criteria:** You personally feel a productivity boost or quality improvement in at least one task (e.g. “Copilot saved me 1 hour on newsletter”), and you have enough understanding to coach others in basic usage.
    
2. **Phase 2 – Team Adoption & Feedback (Months 2–3):** _Extend the pilots to your immediate team and refine with their input._ In this phase, introduce your team to the AI workflows that worked for you, and perhaps pilot new ones in a team context. **Expand use cases:** For example, roll out the **weekly update process** – you might have each of your tech leads use Copilot to send you their weekly highlights, which you then aggregate (with AI help) into a polished team update for executives. Or implement an AI-assisted **project status report**: set up a template and have the team use Copilot to fill in sections (like risk summaries, recent accomplishments) in a consistent manner. Another idea is to use **Copilot in group meetings** – e.g. enable the Teams Copilot live in your team meeting to capture notes and action items, and display the AI-generated summary on-screen at the end to validate it with everyone. **Tool configurations for team:** Ensure everyone has access to Copilot (lobby IT for any additional licenses if needed for your team members). Provide a short training or demo of Writer so that documents or announcements your team drafts for you are AI-refined before they hit your desk. You might set up a **shared prompt library** in a Teams wiki or SharePoint: for instance, a repository of useful prompts you’ve crafted (like “Prompt for design review summary” or “Prompt for drafting OKR updates”). This could even be a simple OneNote page where anyone can contribute new effective prompts they discover. **Feedback loops:** Schedule a retrospective after 4–6 weeks with your team specifically on the AI tooling. Ask questions: Which AI-augmented process has helped you most? Where is the AI causing confusion or errors? Gather their insights and observe outcomes (maybe the quality of weekly reports has improved, but some team members struggle with prompt phrasing – those are coaching opportunities). Be prepared to do some **prompt engineering** tutoring: share tips like how adding detail or context to prompts yields better results. At this stage, you may also gather quantitative data: for example, if your team used to spend 5 hours/week combined on meeting notes and now spends 2 hours with Copilot doing most of it, that’s a measurable win. Use that data to adjust processes and also to make a case for further adoption. **Iterate:** Refine the workflows based on feedback. Perhaps you find that Copilot’s suggestions for code documentation are sometimes off – you might then decide to integrate a quick review step by a human or adjust the prompt given to Copilot (e.g. feed it more context or examples). On the other hand, if something is a smash hit (say, using AI to draft internal tech blogs gets your team excited), double down: formalize that ritual, maybe rotate the responsibility of editing the AI draft among team members to increase buy-in. **Success criteria:** By end of Phase 2, at least a few AI-driven practices are embedded in your team’s routines (e.g. everyone expects the AI-generated meeting notes to be posted, or your team update process is standard). Also, you should see improved outcomes – perhaps faster turnaround on reports or improved completeness of documentation. Team members should report that the AI is _reducing_ grunt work and not adding frustration. It’s also a goal that you become seen as an **internal champion** of practical AI: Phase 2 is when others in the org start noticing (“Hey, how is your team producing so many blog posts?”) – which sets you up for Phase 3 influence.
    
3. **Phase 3 – Scaling Up and Innovating (Month 4 and beyond):** _Integrate AI deeply and lead broader adoption across the organization._ With lessons learned and proven value, Phase 3 involves scaling these practices and exploring more advanced possibilities. **Enterprise integration:** Work on integrating AI into official business processes. For example, if the decision log concept (suggested by AI) improved transparency, propose making a “weekly decision log” a company-wide practice for leadership teams. You might collaborate with IT to connect Copilot to additional internal systems (using the Copilot Studio agents or Power Platform connectors). Perhaps build a **custom Copilot agent** that interfaces with an internal database or CRM – e.g. an “Ops Copilot” that any leader can ask, “What’s the headcount and open roles in each of my teams?” or “Pull the latest customer NPS comments relevant to Project Z.” Microsoft’s general availability of Copilot agents means you can publish such an agent in your tenant for others to use in Teams or Outlook. **New pilot workflows:** Don’t stop innovating – identify new pain points in your executive responsibilities that haven’t been tackled yet. For instance, if you will be involved in annual planning, experiment with AI to analyze large strategy documents or synthesize survey results from employees into key themes. Or use AI in **influence mapping**: prompt it with org chart info and meeting histories to identify “which stakeholders should I consult early for initiative X?” (It might infer patterns like who has been critical in past similar projects). **Skill up the organization:** As you gain mastery, share knowledge. Host an internal workshop or write a brief “AI Augmentation Playbook” highlighting the workflows you implemented and their results. This not only solidifies your thought leadership but also elevates the whole organization’s productivity. You could introduce the concept of everyone being an “AI agent boss” – Microsoft predicts _“from the boardroom to the frontline, every worker will need to think like the CEO of an agent-powered startup.”_ In Phase 3, you embody this by not only running your own AI agents but mentoring colleagues in delegating tasks to AI. **Governance and measurement:** Work with management to establish governance around AI use (e.g. ethical guidelines, quality checks) – since you have hands-on experience, your input here is valuable. Also, track the broad impact: maybe measure team throughput before vs. after, employee engagement changes, or simply tally hours saved across the team by AI (Copilot’s dashboard might even quantify “Copilot assisted hours”). **Feedback loops:** Continue to solicit feedback as usage widens. There will be new challenges at scale (some employees might be resistant or there may be edge cases where AI falters). Address these with training or adjustments. By this phase, you’ll likely be interfacing with senior leadership on AI strategy – armed with pilot results and ground-level insights, you can influence enterprise AI direction. **Success criteria:** AI augmentation is no longer a novelty but a norm in your daily operations and is spreading organically in the org. You are recognized as a key advocate and expert, perhaps even formally leading an “AI productivity” initiative. Ultimately, Phase 3 success is when the AI is practically an invisible teammate across many processes, and your focus can shift to strategic decision-making and creative problem-solving – the things humans do best – because the busywork truly has been offloaded to copilots.
    

Throughout these phases, maintain an **iteration loop**: plan -> pilot -> gather feedback -> refine -> expand. AI capabilities are also evolving quickly (Microsoft will push frequent Copilot updates), so revisit earlier workflows to incorporate new features (for example, if Copilot gains an ability to proactively summarize unread emails every morning, you might add that to your routine). This agile approach ensures your AI toolset and practices stay aligned with your needs and actually deliver value.

## **Prompt Templates and Examples**

To help you hit the ground running with effective prompts, below is a library of sample prompts tailored to leadership workflows. These can be used as-is or adapted to your context (and they can be saved in a OneNote or SharePoint for quick reference). Good prompts are key to getting the most out of AI – the following templates illustrate the level of detail and clarity that yields optimal results:

- **Weekly Update Email Prompt:** _“Draft a concise weekly update for my team’s stakeholders. Include 3 bullet points: one summarizing our main achievement this week (Project updates), one on any metric or KPI change, and one on next week’s focus. Use a professional yet upbeat tone. Base it on the following notes: [paste bullet list of highlights].”_ (Use Outlook Copilot or Word Copilot for this. After generation, consider running it through Writer to enforce style.)
    
- **Meeting Summary Prompt (with Action Items):** _“Summarize the discussion from today’s Project Delta meeting. Identify key decisions made and list any action items with owner and due date. Format the summary as 5-6 bullet points under ‘Decisions’ and ‘Actions’. Also, highlight any unresolved questions.”_ (Teams Copilot can handle this if the meeting was recorded/transcribed. If not, you can paste the raw notes into Copilot Chat. This prompt ensures the AI output is structured and actionable.)
    
- **One-on-One Reflection Prompt:** _“Analyze the notes from my last 3 one-on-one meetings with [Employee Name]. Identify any recurring themes or concerns they’ve mentioned. Given those, suggest two thoughtful follow-up questions I should ask in our next 1:1 to support them.”_ (This prompt, run through an AI like ChatGPT or Copilot Chat, helps you uncover patterns. For example, an AI might notice the employee mentioned workload stress twice – and it could suggest asking about specific blockers. This is adapted from real use where AI found patterns in meeting notes.)
    
- **Decision Log Explanation Prompt:** _“I decided to postpone the Q4 product release due to quality issues. Draft a brief decision log entry explaining the ‘Why’ behind this decision, the options considered, and how it aligns with our long-term strategy. Write it in a transparent tone for all team members to understand. Include a note on who was consulted.”_ (You can use this prompt in Word Copilot or an AI chat to document major decisions. It creates a record that can be shared or archived. An AI can ensure you articulate the rationale clearly, which improves trust.)
    
- **Stakeholder Email Personalization Prompt:** _“Using the draft below, adjust the tone and content for sending to [Stakeholder Name] (who is concerned about X). Make it concise and address her main concern about Y directly in the first paragraph. Ensure the email maintains a respectful and collaborative tone, and adds a line thanking her for her input on Z.”_ (Use this with Writer or Outlook Copilot. Provide the draft email and let the AI personalize it. This ensures each stakeholder communication feels tailored – AI can recall their concern if you prompt it with context. It’s like having an editor remind you to address what matters most to that person.)
    
- **Brainstorming Coach Prompt:** _“I’m stuck evaluating two solutions for a platform architecture issue (Solution A vs Solution B). Help me brainstorm by listing: the key benefits and risks of each solution, any blind spots I might be missing, and a few criteria to consider (e.g. cost, scalability, team expertise). Then suggest a possible third approach or compromise.”_ (This prompt turns the AI into a brainstorming partner. It encourages comprehensive analysis and even creativity. It’s useful in your journal or when prepping for a decision. Leaders have found that AI can broaden their perspective in decision-making.)
    
- **Team Kudos Social Post Prompt:** _“Compose a brief, engaging message to post on our internal network (Viva Engage) praising my team for successfully migrating Service X to the cloud ahead of schedule. Mention the key stat (20% performance improvement), thank specific members (Alice and Bob) for their extra effort, and express confidence in the team’s innovation. Keep it motivational and positive in tone.”_ (Use Copilot in Viva Engage or Word. This prompt helps ensure you hit all the notes of recognition, data, and optimism. The AI will help wordsmith it so it doesn’t come off as stiff. This contributes to your internal thought leadership by publicly acknowledging wins.)
    

Feel free to refine these templates over time. You should also **save effective prompts** that you or your team discover. For example, if you find a great prompt for extracting just the right dashboard insight (“Explain the dip in throughput in non-technical terms…”), add it to the library. Microsoft’s Copilot Prompt Gallery is a handy reference – it shows many example prompts and even lets you share prompts with colleagues. Developing a **prompt library** is a one-time effort that will continually pay off by ensuring everyone is using AI consistently and getting high-quality outputs. Think of prompts as reusable micro-programs – invest in good ones.

## **Developing AI-First Leadership Skills**

Adopting these tools and workflows isn’t just about technology – it’s about evolving your leadership skills and mindset. To support your executive trajectory, focus on building the following AI-era leadership competencies:

- **AI-Assisted Strategic Storytelling:** The ability to craft and communicate compelling narratives with AI as your collaborator. This goes beyond delegating writing to an assistant – it’s learning how to guide the AI to amplify your strategic message. Practice translating your vision and strategy into prompts that yield persuasive content (presentations, memos, speeches), and then refine the output with your insights. For example, you might use Copilot to turn raw strategy points into a cohesive story, then add anecdotal context that the AI wouldn’t know. By doing this repeatedly, you’ll hone an intuition for _prompting_ the right story structure. This skill will make you faster at creating executive communications (strategy docs, business cases) while keeping the human element strong. Moreover, leverage AI to **iterate** your storytelling – get suggestions to strengthen your arguments or adjust tone for different audiences. Great leaders are great storytellers; with AI, you can develop multiple narratives quickly and choose the most impactful. As you grow, this extends to spoken storytelling too: you might use tools to simulate Q&As or practice framing your narrative, effectively using AI as a rehearsal partner. Embracing AI in storytelling will differentiate you as an executive who communicates a vision in a clear, data-backed, and resonant way, at scale.
    
- **Decision Log Discipline and Influence Tracking:** In the AI-first era, leaders will be expected to be very transparent and data-informed in their decisions. Develop the habit (with AI help) of maintaining a **decision log** – a running record of major decisions and their rationale. This not only forces clarity in your thought process but also provides material to feed AI analysis. For instance, after logging a few decisions, you could ask an AI, “What patterns do you see in the reasons for my decisions this quarter?” – it might reveal biases or strategic consistency you hadn’t seen. In one case, an AI recommended implementing a weekly decision log to explain the “why” behind decisions and clarify decision-making authority. When that suggestion was implemented, the team’s engagement spiked – showing the power of transparent communication. Make it a skill to _use AI to evaluate how you’re communicating decisions_ and their effects on stakeholders. Influence tracking is related – it’s being deliberate about understanding and mapping how your messages and decisions propagate among stakeholders. Use AI to sift through feedback channels (emails, chat comments, survey results) for sentiment analysis. For example, after a big announcement, you could ask Copilot, “Summarize the responses and sentiment from the team about this decision.” This gives you a pulse on your influence. Over time, you’ll develop an intuition for reading stakeholder dynamics, but AI will be your safety net to catch what you miss. By automating the tracking of influence (who’s on board, who needs convincing), you can proactively engage stakeholders. This skill makes you a more politically savvy executive who uses data and AI to navigate organizational complexity. The end result is better-informed decisions, communicated with context and empathy, leading to trust – and trust is the currency of influence.
    
- **Ritual Automation and Continuous Improvement:** Commit to an ongoing practice of **automating rituals** and reflecting on their effectiveness. It’s not one-and-done – as an AI-forward leader, you’ll regularly scan your activities for automation opportunities. Cultivate the skill of quickly prototyping an AI or shortcut to improve a workflow. For instance, if you find yourself doing a tedious weekly task, get in the habit of thinking, “Could my AI co-pilot do this?” and spend an hour to see if it’s feasible. This experimental mindset – treating your own workflow as a sandbox – will keep you ahead of the curve. Additionally, develop comfort with **feedback loops involving AI**. Sometimes the AI will get it wrong; treat those moments as chances to improve your guidance (prompts or examples). By iteratively tuning your automated rituals, you instill a culture of continuous improvement. Document your processes (maybe in a Wiki or your journal) including what’s automated and what isn’t, so you have a clear picture of your “personal operating system.” This meta-skill of designing and refining your work rituals is crucial as you rise to higher leadership – it frees up time and mental energy for strategic matters. It also sets an example for your team and peers: you become the leader who is always optimizing, learning, and sharing productivity hacks. In practical terms, this might mean scheduling quarterly self-reviews of your AI usage: e.g. “Q2 check – which new Copilot features can I integrate? Which manual tasks are creeping back in?” Staying disciplined in ritual automation ensures you _sustain_ the cognitive benefits of AI and don’t slip back into old habits as things get busy.
    
- **AI-First Thought Leadership and Mentorship:** Perhaps the most career-defining skill will be positioning yourself as an **AI thought leader** within your organization. This doesn’t mean you must be a technical AI expert; rather, be the one who deeply understands how to leverage AI for business value and can educate and inspire others. Develop the ability to articulate the benefits your team has reaped from AI augmentation – with concrete examples and ROI metrics – and communicate a vision for broader adoption. This could involve leading workshops, publishing an internal newsletter on “Working Smarter with AI” (which of course, you can draft with Copilot!), or volunteering to pilot enterprise AI initiatives. Additionally, hone your mentorship skills in the AI context: coach other managers or emerging leaders on integrating AI into their workflows. Just as you might mentor someone in strategic planning, you’ll mentor them in prompt crafting or selecting the right tool for a task. Being generous with your knowledge increases your influence and cements your reputation as a forward-looking leader. Keep abreast of AI trends relevant to enterprise productivity – for instance, stay informed on Microsoft’s latest Copilot features or new Mac automation capabilities – so you can advise on next steps (your boss might ask, “Should we invest in training employees on AI agents?” and you’ll have an informed opinion). This continual learning mindset is key; pair it with sharing insights widely. Microsoft leaders note that tomorrow’s workers will all need to manage AI agents – position yourself as a pioneer of that movement. Externally, this skill can translate to speaking at industry events or contributing case studies about your AI adoption journey, raising your profile. Internally, it might mean you’re tapped to lead the AI Center of Excellence or similar. In summary, make it part of your leadership brand that you are “AI-first” – you leverage AI in your own work, champion its ethical and effective use, and drive cultural change so that your organization fully embraces these new capabilities. This not only propels the company forward but also accelerates your path to executive roles, as companies will highly value leaders who can navigate and exploit the AI revolution.
    

## **Maintaining Visibility and Influence Across Stakeholders**

Finally, an important consideration: as you offload tasks to AI and streamline communications, how do you ensure you remain **highly visible and influential** to your stakeholders (executives, peers, team members, customers)? The key is to pair **high-frequency, high-quality communication** (enabled by AI) with genuine human engagement. Here’s a framework to maintain and even boost your leadership presence:

- **Consistency with Authenticity:** AI allows you to communicate more regularly – weekly updates, frequent kudos posts, decision logs, etc., can all be produced with less effort. Use this to increase the _cadence_ of your communications, but always add a personal authentic touch. For example, Copilot might draft your update, but you add one personal anecdote or insight to it. Stakeholders will see you as **present and engaged** because you’re consistently in their field of view (in meetings, in inboxes, on internal social platforms) with substantive messages. The authenticity in tone will reassure them it’s _you_ behind the curtain, using AI as an aid, not a robot spamming them. In practice: maintain your own voice – perhaps use Writer to ensure it matches your known style. If you have a sense of humor or a particular value you emphasize, make sure that comes through in what AI helps you write.
    
- **Transparency in Process:** Don’t hide the fact that you leverage AI – instead, turn it into a thought-leadership point. For instance, if you start a weekly decision log visible to your team, explain that it was inspired by new AI-driven insights on transparency. This vulnerability (“I’m trying this new thing with help from AI to keep everyone informed”) can increase trust – your stakeholders see you as cutting-edge _and_ candid. It also demystifies AI for others, potentially encouraging them to adopt similar openness. That said, be judicious: you need not mention AI in every message (which could undermine the message’s perceived sincerity), but occasionally referencing that you use tools to work smarter reinforces your influence as a tech-savvy leader. It sets you apart as someone who not only talks about innovation but demonstrates it in day-to-day work.
    
- **Personal Touch at Key Moments:** Automate the routine so you can _invest more time in personal interactions where it matters_. For example, if AI helps you free an hour that you used to spend compiling reports, reinvest that hour in face-to-face (or video) conversations with stakeholders – the relationship-building that AI can’t do. Schedule regular check-ins with your key stakeholders (your skip-level manager, important cross-functional peers, top talent in your team) and use your now-buffered schedule to be fully present in those. You can even use AI to prep for those meetings (quickly briefing you on past interactions or likely discussion topics), so that when you show up, you’re well-informed and attentive. People will notice that you are **on top of details** and responsive to their interests – which boosts your credibility and influence. Essentially, let AI handle the information management so you can focus on emotional intelligence and connection in stakeholder management.
    
- **Data-Driven Influence Tracking:** Take advantage of the digital trace of communications to monitor your reach and impact. Many enterprise tools (Viva Insights, etc.) can show engagement metrics – e.g. how many people opened your newsletter, or which parts of the organization are interacting with your posts. Use AI to analyze these metrics, perhaps via a custom dashboard or simply asking, _“Copilot, analyze the past 3 months of my update emails: what is the average open rate and which sections do readers engage with (via replies or follow-ups)?”_ If you find, say, that your technical deep-dives in the update get little traction but the customer success stories get mentioned in replies by execs, that’s a clue to adjust your content strategy. Similarly, track who’s giving you feedback or questions – if certain important stakeholders never respond, you might proactively reach out or tweak how you address their concerns in your comms. This systematic approach ensures you’re not in the dark about your influence; you have a **feedback loop** on how well you’re resonating with your audience. You can even use AI to draft follow-up questions to stakeholders like, _“Hi, I noticed you didn’t get a chance to attend the last review – would a one-page summary be useful?”_ This shows attentiveness. Over time, this data-driven adjustment will maximize your positive visibility – you’re seen in the right places, saying the things that matter to your stakeholders.
    
- **Delivering Impact, Not Just Activity:** AI can flood the channels with content, but **substance** is what sustains influence. Make sure the outputs you produce with AI actually drive value. For example, sending a summary after every meeting is good, but how do you ensure people read it and act on it? Perhaps highlight 1-2 critical action items at the top (manually, if needed, emphasizing what you truly need others to do). For your weekly updates, tie them to stakeholder priorities explicitly (“and this helps address the Q3 cost goal, Jane”). Use AI to gather those priority linkages by querying, for instance, _“What are the top objectives of exec X mentioned in emails?”_ and then framing your messaging in terms of outcomes that exec cares about. By aligning AI-boosted communications with stakeholder goals, you demonstrate strategic acumen, not just productivity. In essence, you guide the AI to help you work smarter _on the right things_. This will maintain and grow your influence because people see results: decisions clearly communicated and executed, projects moving faster, team morale improving (backed by the engagement uptick from decision transparency as in the earlier example).
    

In summary, **AI-augmented leadership** is a force multiplier: it lets you communicate more, analyze more, and manage more without burning out – but it’s your human insight and leadership that give direction to that force. By mastering these tools and approaches, you will reduce the busywork and free capacity to lead at a higher level. You’ll be known as the leader who is always **on point** with information, quick to respond, and ahead of the curve, all while nurturing your team and strategically influencing the organization. Embrace the journey of continuous learning and experimentation with AI. As you do, you’re not just making your own job easier – you’re pioneering a new model of leadership for the company. And that positions you squarely on the path to executive success, as someone who can harness technology to amplify human potential and drive meaningful change.
