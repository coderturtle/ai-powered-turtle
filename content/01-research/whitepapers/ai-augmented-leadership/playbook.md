Awesome—here’s a **practical operating-model playbook (v1)** you can hand to teams _now_ and brief the execs on this afternoon. It’s opinionated but modular: pick the patterns that fit each product’s maturity (UKPI vs FAS). I’ve focused on: **(1) how the SDLC changes**, **(2) how roles evolve/merge**, and **(3) boxed experiments** you can run with existing teams to prove value and set direction.

# Operating-Model Playbook (v1)

## 0) Principles

- **Template, not straitjacket.** Choose patterns by product + org maturity.
    
- **Dual speed, single pipeline.** Rapid prototyping and scalable delivery share one governance spine.
    
- **Controls as code.** Every stage gate is an automated check.
    
- **Reskill > redeploy > hire.** Talent first; redundancies are last resort.
    
- **UKPI ≠ FAS.** Optimize UKPI for pace & CX; optimize FAS for integration, SLAs, and data rigor.

## 1) SDLC 2.0 — How we build now (Discovery → MVP → Scale)

### Stages & exit criteria

1. **Discovery / Rapid Prototyping (1–3 weeks)**
    
    - **Outputs:** problem framing, _throwaway_ and/or _seedable_ prototypes, early value & risk hypothesis, initial AI evaluation plan (golden questions, red-team prompts), cost/benefit sketch.
        
    - **Exit:** prototype demo passes UX fit; _if AI is used_, eval harness ≥ baseline (accuracy/latency/safety), data source available (or plan to create).
        
2. **MVP / Alpha (4–12 weeks)**
    
    - **Outputs:** “Minimum lovable” slice; **seedable prototype code refactored** behind platform rails; thin slice in prod (ring-fenced), model card v1, SLOs, FinOps tags; privacy, model, and security checks in CI.
        
    - **Exit:** Real users, real telemetry; DORA+Flow baseline; AI eval tests stable; reversible releases.
        
3. **Scale / Beta→GA (12+ weeks, iterative)**
    
    - **Outputs:** hardened services, self-serve runbooks, golden paths, data contracts, SLOs & error budgets, control automation (EU AI Act/GDPR/DORA), cost guardrails, observability & drift alerts.
        
    - **Exit:** SLOs met 3 cycles; change-fail <15%; MTTR down vs. baseline; AI cost/benefit ≥ target; audit artifacts auto-produced.
        

### The “dual-track” we actually run

- **Track A — Discovery/Design/Prototype** (fast loops, low ceremony)
    
- **Track B — Delivery/Hardening** (trunk-based, paved roads, high automation)

### Rapid prototyping: what “good” looks like

- **Time-boxed:** 48–72 hours to a decisionable demo.
    
- **Types:**
    
    - _Throwaway:_ spikes to validate desirability/feasibility.
        
    - _Seedable:_ code style, licenses, and dependencies allow **direct promotion** to MVP rails.
        
- **Guardrails:** no customer PII; synthetic or sanctioned data; prompts & tools stored in a sandbox registry; auto redaction; eval run before any user test.
    
- **Heuristic to seed vs. throw away**
    
    - Seed if: problem well-framed, latency acceptable, eval ≥ baseline, dependencies compatible with platform rails.
        
    - Throw away if: unknown data quality, security concern, or bespoke infra needed.
        

### Repo & pipeline shape (keeps speed AND safety)

```
/product-area/
  /discovery/
    /spikes/                  # always throwaway
    /seedable-prototypes/     # linted, licenced, paved-road-ready
  /app/
    /mvp/                     # feature flags, ring-fenced envs
    /services/                # hardened APIs, contracts, tests
  /ai/
    /prompts/                 # versioned, reviewed
    /tools/                   # audited tool adapters
    /evals/                   # golden questions + red-team
  /ops/
    /runbooks/                # human + agentic runbooks
    /observability/           # SLOs, dashboards, alerts
```

## 2) Ways of Working — Cadence, artifacts, and gates

**Cadence**

- **Weekly:** Discovery demo (10 mins per team), Platform office hours.
    
- **Bi-weekly:** Release & risk review (pipeline evidence), Customer council (UKPI) / Partner council (FAS).
    
- **Monthly:** North-Star review (DORA, Flow, CX, AI value), Experiment readout.
    

**Core artifacts (automated where possible)**

- _Problem brief_ (one-pager), _MVP charter_ (scope, SLOs, risks), _Model card_ (if AI), _Eval plan & results_, _Data contract_, _FinOps budget & tags_, _ADR set_, _Runbook_ (human/agent).
    

**Gates (automated)**

1. **Proto→MVP:** eval pass, dependency check, license check, threat model stub.
    
2. **MVP→Scale:** SLO burn rate stable, change-fail rate OK, cost per txn within guardrail, risk sign-off from pipeline evidence (no slides).
    
3. **Scale→GA:** error budgets healthy for 3 sprints, audit pack auto-generates, on-call & agentic runbooks validated.

## 3) Roles — How they evolve/merge

|Current Role|Future Shape|Key Changes|
|---|---|---|
|**Product Owner**|**Product Manager (AI-literate)**|Owns value & outcomes; writes hypothesis & eval plans; manages model risk backlog with Tech Lead.|
|**Delivery Lead**|**Product Ops Lead**|Owns flow efficiency, capacity, and the controls-as-code spine; combines agile facilitation with release/FinOps telemetry.|
|**Tech Lead**|**Staff Engineer / Architecture Owner**|Owns the paved-road adoption, ADRs, domain boundaries; pairs with AI Engineer on agent/tool design.|
|**Architect**|**Principal/Staff Architect (governance-as-code)**|Curates standards, reference impls; runs design clinics; enforces policies via pipelines, not meetings.|
|**Agile Coach**|**Flow Coach**|Obsessed with DORA/Flow, bottleneck analysis, playbook adoption; lighter ceremonies, more coaching on metrics.|
|**QA / Test**|**SDET & Quality-in-Prod**|Contract tests, synthetic users, chaos/eval tests; tests are part of paved roads; fewer manual stages.|
|**SRE**|**AI Ops/SRE**|Adds eval/diff/drift monitoring, agent runbook automation, cost SLOs; co-owns incident templates with PM.|
|**Data Scientist / MLE**|**AI Engineer**|End-to-end: prompts, tools, evals, safety, deployment via MCP/LLM gateway; collaborates on model risk.|

> **Mergers likely:** _Delivery Lead + Agile Coach → Product Ops Lead_. _Tech Lead + Solution Architect → Staff Engineer (Area Architecture Owner)._  
> **Sunsetting as standalone:** Release Manager, Manual Ops Executor, Standalone Reporting Analyst.

## 4) Paved Roads (must-use accelerators)

- **IDP:** trunk-based CI, ephemeral envs, templates for API/worker/UI.
    
- **Data platform:** contracts, versioned schemas, quality SLAs (Kafka/Flink/Iceberg).
    
- **AI platform:** MCP/LLM gateway, policy engine, prompt/tool registry, evaluation harness, model cards.
    
- **Observability & FinOps:** SLOs, error budgets, AI cost per invocation/use-case, budget alerts.
    
- **Security & privacy:** secret scanning, PII redaction, SBOM, threat modeling in CI.
    

---

## 5) UKPI vs FAS: how the playbook bends

- **UKPI (B2C, UK-only):** shorter discovery cycles, stronger MarTech/Service emphasis, **faster ring-progression** if safety holds; heavy on CX telemetry & service-desk copilot.
    
- **FAS (EU advisor):** discovery includes API/CRM integration checks, data lineage & reporting SLAs; **proto demos include partner workflow**; stricter model-risk evidence.
