Here’s a **pre-filled Launch Kit** you can paste straight into Confluence/Notion/GitHub.

# Rings of Risk — Launch Kit

**Tagline:** **_Prove it, then promote it._**

> A lightweight, gamified way to move ideas → pilots → production with safety, speed, and evidence.  
> Works across both LOBs: **UKPI (B2C)** and **EU FAS (advisor-led)**.

---

## 1) What this is (one paragraph for execs & teams)

**Rings of Risk** is our gated path for AI-enabled features and services: **R0 Sandbox → R1 Prototype → R2 Limited Pilot → R3 Controlled Prod → R4 Broad Prod**. Each promotion is earned by **pipeline proofs** (evals, privacy/DPIA, SLOs, incident drills, FinOps tags). No extra meetings—**prove it, then promote it**.

## 3) How it works (cheat-sheet)

|Ring|Where|Who|Data policy|Purpose|Promotion proof (examples)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**R0 Sandbox**|Local/isolated|Individuals|**Synthetic/public only**|Spikes, prompt/tool sketch|Lint/license pass; 5-min demo; seedability check|
|**R1 Prototype**|Secure dev/test|Squad + platform|**Pseudonymised/synthetic**|Seedable proto; eval baselines|Eval ≥ baseline; DPIA screen; threats/SBOM|
|**R2 Limited Pilot**|Ring-fenced / staff-only prod|Staff/opt-in users|**Minimised live data**|Shadow/A-B; HIL|DPIA (if high-risk); incident drill; consent & logs|
|**R3 Controlled Prod**|Segmented prod|Target cohort|**Live data under SLOs**|Value at limited scale|SLOs green 2–3 sprints; model validation; rollback tested|
|**R4 Broad Prod**|Full prod|All eligible users|As above|Business-critical|Red-team & fairness cadence; MI for outcomes & costs|

2) Pin last-good prompt/model/tool version
3) Notify on-call + #ai-incident
## Investigation
Gather logs, prompts, inputs (pseudonymised), outputs.
## Communication
Internal update at T+30, stakeholder update at T+60.
## Post-incident
Root cause, control update, regression test added.
```

## 10) Ready-to-run boxed experiments (Season 1)

1. **E1 — 48-Hour AI Sprint (R0→R1)**  
    _Hypothesis:_ time-to-decision ↓ 60%.  
    _Measure:_ prototype lead time; eval pass rate.
    
2. **E2 — Seedable Proto → MVP Rails (R1→R2)**  
    _Hypothesis:_ MVP cycle time ↓ 30%.  
    _Measure:_ cycle time; rework %; audit pack completeness.
    
3. **E3 — Agentic Incident Triage (R2→R3)**  
    _Hypothesis:_ MTTR ↓ 40%; unsafe actions ≤5%.  
    _Measure:_ MTTR; false-positive rate.
    
4. **E4 — Shift-Left Controls as Code**  
    _Hypothesis:_ approval time ↓ 50% with zero control regressions.  
    _Measure:_ “ready→pilot” time; manual reviews avoided.

## 11) FAQs (for launch)

- **Is this extra bureaucracy?** No—gates are **automated** in CI/CD. We replace review meetings with proofs.
    
- **What if an experiment fails?** You still score if safety held and we documented learning.
    
- **Do all teams follow identical gates?** The spine is common; **thresholds** flex by product maturity (UKPI vs FAS).
    
- **Can we skip rings?** Only with explicit risk sign-off and a rollback plan—rare.
