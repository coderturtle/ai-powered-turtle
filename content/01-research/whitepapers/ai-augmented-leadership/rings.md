Love it. Here’s a tight **brand kit + gamified launch** for the Rings-of-Risk that you can drop into decks, Confluence, Slack, and all-hands.

# Tagline options (pick one)

1. **“Ship fast, stay safe—one ring at a time.”**
    
2. “Speed with safety, by design.”
    
3. “From sandbox to scale, safely.”
    
4. “Prove it, then promote it.”
    
5. “Value at velocity. Risk under control.”
    

**My pick for broad audiences:** **Ship fast, stay safe—one ring at a time.**  
Short, memorable, and clearly connects rings → speed + safety.

# Logo system (simple, flexible, developer-friendly)

**Concept:** three nested rings (risk tiers) with a center **✔︎** (governed release). Works in monochrome, small sizes, and makes great Slack emoji.

**Primary mark (SVG)** — copy into Figma/Illustrator or drop straight into your site:

```svg
<svg width="320" height="320" viewBox="0 0 256 256" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img" aria-label="Rings of Risk">
  <title>Rings of Risk</title>
  <circle cx="128" cy="128" r="90" stroke="#0EA5E9" stroke-width="10"/>
  <circle cx="128" cy="128" r="66" stroke="#6366F1" stroke-width="10"/>
  <circle cx="128" cy="128" r="42" stroke="#10B981" stroke-width="10"/>
  <path d="M97 129l18 18 44-44" stroke="#10B981" stroke-width="12" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
</svg>
```

**Palette (accessible, fintech-friendly)**

- Indigo `#6366F1` (governance/controls)
    
- Sky `#0EA5E9` (discovery/experiments)
    
- Emerald `#10B981` (promotion/success)
    
- Slate `#0F172A` (text), White `#FFFFFF` (background)
    

**Variants**

- **“Shield” lockup** (for regulators/executive decks): place the rings inside a thin shield outline.
    
- **“Turtle shell” easter-egg** (for team swag): faint hex pattern behind the rings to nod to Coderturtle.
    

**Usage**

- 24–32 px: icon only.
    
- 48–96 px: icon + tagline in one line.
    
- Dark mode: keep strokes, invert background.

# Gamified narrative — “The Five Rings”

**Story hook (60 seconds at all-hands):**  
“You’re joining the **Guild of the Five Rings**. Every feature, model, or agent starts as a **Novice** in R0 and ascends—**R1** Prototype, **R2** Pilot, **R3** Controlled, **R4** Broad—by **proving** safety and value. Beat the bosses (FCA Consumer Duty, GDPR/DPIA, DORA, EU AI Act, PRA MRM) to collect your **Ring Pass** and level up.”

**Bosses per ring**

- **R1 Boss:** DPIA screening & baseline evals (GDPR/UK-GDPR).
    
- **R2 Boss:** Transparency, cohort consent, logging (EU AI Act), incident drill (DORA).
    
- **R3 Boss:** Human-in-the-loop + SLOs + model validation (PRA MRM-style).
    
- **R4 Boss:** Ongoing fairness tests + change control via pipeline + MI for Consumer Duty.
    

**Player roles (classes)**

- **Ranger (PM):** hunts value, manages quests & hypothesis.
    
- **Guardian (Product Ops):** keeps the ring gates honest (controls-as-code).
    
- **Artificer (AI Engineer):** crafts prompts/tools/evals.
    
- **Warden (AI Ops/SRE):** protects uptime, drift, and costs.
    
- **Lorekeeper (Risk/Privacy):** approves passes, keeps the codex.

# Mechanics (how teams “win”)

**Season length:** 12 weeks. **Season goal:** push 3 initiatives from their current ring to at least the next ring **without** a control breach.

**Scoring (Ring Score, per initiative)**

- +30 pts promotion gate passed on time
    
- +20 pts eval coverage ≥ target (incl. fairness)
    
- +15 pts DPIA on file (if required) with residual risk tracked
    
- +15 pts incident drill passed (R2+)
    
- +10 pts SLO burn rate < threshold (R3+)
    
- +10 pts AI cost/use-case within budget (FinOps)
    
- −25 pts for any **red** control; −10 pts for late audit artefacts
    

**Badges**

- **Proto Pro** (R1): baseline evals green
    
- **Pilot Paladin** (R2): staff-only pilot live with logs ≥6 months
    
- **Guardian of GA** (R3): kill-switch + rollback drill passed
    
- **Duty Champion** (R4): Consumer Duty MI shows improved outcomes
    
- **Zero-To-Hero**: R0→R3 in one season, no reds
    

**Leaderboards**

- **By squad** (UKPI vs FAS)
    
- **By craft** (AI Eng, Product Ops, SRE)
    
- **Ring Masters**: most promotions with zero reds
    

**Rewards (lightweight)**

- Executive shout-out slide, lunch budget, conference/learning stipend, custom Slack emoji for the team.

# Launch kit (copy-paste)

**All-hands opener (60 sec)**

> _“Today we’re launching **Rings-of-Risk**. It’s how we **ship fast and stay safe—one ring at a time**. Each team adopts our ring gates: prototype in R1, pilot in R2, controlled prod in R3, and broad release in R4. You’ll earn **Ring Passes** by proving value **and** controls in the pipeline—no extra meetings. Leaderboards go live Monday; season ends in 12 weeks. Let’s level up.”_

**Slack post**

> 🎮 **Rings-of-Risk Season 1** is live.  
> 🧪 Pick one initiative to move **up 1 ring** in 12 weeks.  
> ✅ Gates = automated checks (evals, DPIA, SLOs, FinOps).  
> 🏅 Badges + leaderboards weekly.  
> 🔗 Playbook, templates, and logo assets in #rings-of-risk.

**Poster copy**

# Assets you can drop into the playbook

**Ring Pass (card template)**

- Back: 5 checkboxes (evals, DPIA, SLOs, incident drill, FinOps tag) + owner + target date
    

**One-slide explainer (structure)**

- Left: the 5 rings with the logo; Right: “Bosses” per ring; Bottom: “Promotion = pipeline-green”
    

**Slack emoji set (32×32)**

- `:ring_r0:`, `:ring_r1:`, … `:ring_r4:`, `:ring_pass:`, `:ring_boss:`  
    (Export the SVG above at 32px and 64px; invert for dark backgrounds.)

# How this lands with each audience

- **Exec/Board:** “We’ve turned governance into an incentive system. Pipeline proofs replace meetings. Season 1 aims for 6–9 ring promotions with zero red controls.”
    
- **Teams:** “It’s a game with a scoreboard. Do the work once, earn the badge, move on. Paved roads + templates mean less admin, faster promotions.”

If you want, I can package these into a **mini asset pack** (SVGs, PNGs, Slack emojis, and a one-slide explainer) and a **Confluence/Notion page** with the launch kit pre-filled.
