Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs the **finalized deep research prompt** with the **core enterprise tool stack** explicitly incorporated: **Microsoft 365 (including Teams and Copilot), GitHub, and Atlassian tools (Jira and Confluence)**. I've also added optional tools and integrations where helpful, ensuring this aligns with an enterprise-grade SDLC environment.

## üíº Deep Research Prompt: Tracking Engineering & Architecture Decisions Across the SDLC

You are the **Head of Architecture** at a technology company. You are launching a deep research initiative to explore **novel and intuitive ways** to **track decisions made by engineering and architecture teams** throughout the **entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.

This initiative must cover both **formal architecture and design decisions**‚Äîwhich go through peer review, Architecture Review Boards (ARB), and design forums‚Äîas well as **informal day-to-day implementation decisions** made by developers. The goal is to create an integrated framework that ensures all material technical decisions are visible, traceable, and actionable, across distributed teams and modern enterprise tooling.

## üéØ Key Deliverables

You are expected to deliver:

1. **Decision Tracking Framework**

   * Templates for **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** and **Design Decision Logs (DDLs)**
   * Defined lifecycle workflows for **proposing, reviewing, approving, rejecting, and revisiting** decisions
   * Role and responsibility matrix for stakeholders involved in both architecture and implementation-level decisions

2. **Informal Decision Capture Mechanism**

   * Lightweight approaches to **logging decisions in the flow of work**, e.g.:

     * GitHub pull requests and commits
     * Jira issue comments and resolutions
     * Teams chat threads
     * Meeting notes captured in OneNote or Confluence
   * Linking informal decisions to formal architecture artefacts

3. **Governance Model**

   * Embeds decision tracking across SDLC gates:

     * Discovery ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Release ‚Üí Maintain
   * Establishes **controls and reminders** if decisions are missing at key lifecycle stages
   * Defines a review cadence for aging or deprecated decisions

4. **Tool Integration Strategy**

   * Focused on your **core enterprise stack**:

     * **Microsoft 365 Copilot** to automate note summarization, detect decisions in meeting transcripts, and prompt authorship of DDLs
     * **Microsoft Teams** to track decision threads and escalate unresolved design issues
     * **GitHub (including GitHub Copilot)** to auto-suggest decision records in PRs, tag design deviations, and link to historical ADRs
     * **Atlassian Jira** to enforce structured decision metadata on stories/epics and create audit-ready workflows
     * **Confluence** to serve as the master knowledge repository for ADRs/DDLs, linked to Jira and GitHub
   * Optional tools to explore:

     * **Obsidian** or **Notion** for team-level technical journals or whiteboard logs
     * **Slack GPT** (if cross-org comms are needed) for ephemeral decisions
     * **LLM agents** embedded in Confluence or Teams to act as decision librarians

5. **AI-Augmented Workflows**

   * How AI tools can minimize decision tracking effort:

     * **Copilot for Microsoft 365**: Detect decisions in meetings, emails, chats; generate DDL drafts; notify owners of missing rationale
     * **GitHub Copilot**: Suggest ADR or DDL updates during pull request creation or code review
     * **Confluence AI**: Tag, summarize, and relate pages to similar past decisions
     * **Jira Automation + AI**: Flag stories with undocumented design decisions; generate ticket-linked DDLs
     * **Agent-based assistants**: Recommend past decisions based on context, nudge authors during documentation gaps, auto-generate Mermaid diagrams
   * Investigate **data pipelines** or APIs to surface a unified "decision history feed" across these tools

6. **Reusable Artifacts**

   * ADR and DDL templates in Markdown and Confluence formats
   * Mermaid diagram flows for:

     * Decision lifecycle
     * Governance and gatekeeping
     * Tool interactions
   * SDLC decision checklist by phase
   * Integration matrix of tools and plugins

## üîç Key Research Questions
* How can traceability be enforced without harming developer velocity?
* How do high-performing engineering teams link low-level implementation decisions to architecture?
* What processes and tools are best suited for federated, multi-tool decision narratives?
* How can AI tools assist in capturing, tagging, summarizing, validating, or visualizing decisions?
* Can LLM agents act as intelligent "decision librarians" to surface historical context in future work?* * How can we reduce the cognitive and documentation load while improving traceability?
* Which decisions warrant formal capture and which can remain informal?
* What is the best way to unify decisions from GitHub, Jira, Teams, and Confluence into one discoverable narrative?
* How can LLMs and copilots be safely and effectively embedded into decision-making workflows?
