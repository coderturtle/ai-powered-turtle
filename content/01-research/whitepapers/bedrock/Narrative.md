## 1. The big picture — Bedrock is our AI “landing zone”

Generative AI is moving from PoCs to production across financial services.  
At the same time, the **EU AI Act** (first obligations in Aug 2025) and incoming UK/FCA oversight demand strict controls.  

**AWS Bedrock** gives us a *walled-garden* of fully-managed foundation models, private fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and Guardrails behind a single AWS-native API.  
By treating Bedrock as our **central AI control-plane**, *every* future tool or agent that calls a model will inherit the same governance, observability and data-sovereignty posture.

## 2. Why the slow burn is worth it

| Up-front effort (2024–H1 2025) | Long-term dividend |
| --- | --- |
| Map high-risk use-cases vs EU AI Act & FCA principles | **Reg-by-design** – one set of controls covers every downstream app |
| Data-classification & GDPR DPIAs for training/embedding corpora | Faster onboarding for new vendors: they just call Bedrock |
| Build **model-level guardrails** (PII redaction, toxic-content filters, trading-advice block-lists) in Guardrails for Bedrock | Reduced legal review cycles and audit time |
| Implement model cards, audit logs & K-records | Evidence pack ready for supervisors & internal audit |
| Align Model-Risk-Management (MRM) playbooks with EBA guidance | Consistent model-risk scoring across the bank |

*Months of plumbing convert future regulatory headwinds into tailwinds.*

## 3. The guardrail stack we’re codifying

1. **Pre-prompt layer** – classify request, attach purpose-ID & user role  
2. **Policy engine** – evaluate prompt + context against EU AI Act, GDPR, MAR & SMCR rule sets  
3. **Bedrock Guardrails** – block / transform / re-route; log immutable trace  
4. **Post-generation filters** – hallucination scoring, privacy scrub, watermarking  
5. **MRM callbacks** – store artefacts for model-risk and fairness dashboards  

Once this scaffold is in place, any new IDE, test tool or design copilot just plugs into the Bedrock endpoint and *inherits* the controls — no fresh DPIA, no separate AI-Act risk log.

## 4. Tooling that will piggy-back on our Bedrock rails

| Persona | Example Bedrock-ready tools | What they gain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cloud / platform / software devs** | Windsurf IDE (agentic code edits), Cursor, Amazon Q Developer | Multi-file refactors & IaC changes with guard-railed model calls |
| **Data & analytics engineers** | Databricks Mosaic AI, Snowflake Cortex, Tabnine SQL | Secure RAG over lake-house data; SQL synthesis with GDPR masking |
| **QA / testers** | testRigor (English-language test generation), Tricentis Testim | 100× faster regression suites while logs stay in-region |
| **Designers / UX** | Figma AI, Galileo AI | Instant prototyping & copy rewrite; brand assets stay inside the garden |
| **Product owners** | Maze PM AI-suite (feedback clustering, auto-PRDs), Zeda.ai | AI-driven insights without exporting PII |
| **Security / risk** | Bedrock Guardrails, Nightfall AI | Inline DLP, insider-trading phrase blocks |

*(Illustrative; final catalogue goes through vendor-risk and Bedrock integration proof.)*

## 5. Illustrative use-cases we can turn on quickly

### SDLC productivity boosters
- **Auto-generate unit & E2E tests** from user stories (testRigor) → 30 % faster sprint velocity  
- **Agentic refactor bots** (Windsurf “Cascade”) cut legacy Java upgrade from weeks to hours  
- **One-click design-to-code**: Figma Make → Bedrock code-gen Lambda  
- **Story → PRD drafting**: Maze / Writer integrated with Confluence  

### Business value plays
- **Reg-compliant client chat-assistant** that explains portfolio moves with auditable citations  
- **Real-time AML anomaly triage**: Bedrock model spots novel mule-patterns, streams to case-manager  
- **Instant policy summarisation**: LLM digests new FCA notices into exec briefs  
- **Personalised financial-wellness nudges** based on transaction semantics  

All land in a Bedrock-controlled namespace, so usage metrics, cost and risk are visible in one pane of glass.

## 6. Roadmap snapshot

| Q3 2025 | Q4 2025 | H1 2026 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • Finish guardrail DSL & policy packs | • First *internal* model registry certified under AI-Act Art 52 | • External vendor-onboarding portal live |
| • Pilot Bedrock with Amazon Q & testRigor in sandbox | • Roll out designer/PM tool set | • Open self-service “Bot-factory” for teams |

---

## 7. Call to action

- **Architects & platform engineers:** join the **Guardrail Guild** to contribute reusable policy snippets.  
- **Domain teams:** nominate *one* high-impact use-case for the sandbox beta.  
- **All staff:** look out for “Bedrock Office Hours” invites — hands-on help to port your prompts.

The delay has been painful, but it positions us to launch **once** and scale **many**.  
Bedrock will give every future AI tool a fast-lane through compliance, so teams can focus on shipping value, not hurdling paperwork.
