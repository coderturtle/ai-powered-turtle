# FinOps Case Studies in GenAI-Driven Fintech & Tech

FinOps teams today face new challenges as Generative AI (GenAI) enters production. With token-based pricing and complex compliance, engineers must prevent “runaway” GenAI spend and ensure accurate cost attribution. We review _named_ case examples – drawn from AWS blogs, FinOps reports, and industry publications – that illustrate both failures and successes in managing GenAI costs. Topics include unchecked token usage, tagging lapses, chargeback implementations, ROI measurement, and new regulatory cost overheads. Wherever possible we cite concrete metrics and outcomes for real companies (especially UK/EU-regulated fintechs), not just best-practice advice.

## Chargeback via AWS Billing Conductor (Amazon)

Amazon’s own teams built a FinOps solution on AWS to handle complex internal pricing. In one case study Amazon used **AWS Billing Conductor** to apply custom internal rates across business units – essentially a large-scale chargeback model. They programmatically generated _thousands_ of pricing rules (via Athena and a Fargate app) so each Amazon division could view its “net AWS cost” under its unique rate card. In a 24‑hour proof-of-concept they produced a pro‑forma cost report matching their legacy system. The result: Amazon could view and charge AWS spend at internal rates, “accurately reflecting their net AWS spend” and enabling ROI tracking. This highlights how using Billing Conductor (and related tools like AWS Cost Explorer) can solve complex showback needs in large organizations. (All errors – minor billing discrepancies from rounding – were trivial to fix.)

## Enforcing Tagging and Cost Ownership (Banks and FinServ)

Strict tagging and clear cost ownership are critical. For example, a leading UK/EU bank ($8.2B market cap) found its AWS migration risks blowing past budget. Tagging was inconsistent and teams lacked cost visibility. LTIMindtree’s FinOps engagement implemented mandatory AWS tag policies (via AWS Config and Service Control Policies) and a business-unit showback model. They required tagging ~95% of resources and even scheduled non-production workloads to stop after hours. Within months this “low-hanging” work (rightsizing, shutdown scripts) yielded _significant cost savings_ and reduced waste. Critically, they “decentralized ownership” of cloud spend by making each unit accountable via chargeback/showback reports. The case study notes these steps had “the potential to save millions of dollars” by improving budget forecasting and efficiency.

Old Mutual (a South African insurance group) offers another cautionary tale: without strong tags, showback was impossible. They created a ServiceNow-based process combining **strict provisioning tags** with manual workflows. Five tag keys were mandatory on all AWS resources (eventually targeting 15). AWS accounts enforced tagging via auto-tagging on launch, and a compliance scan in ServiceNow flagged any violations. Any missing tags triggered an incident ticket and even a “wall of shame” dashboard sent to account owners. This gamified approach forced teams to comply. By taking tagging seriously, Old Mutual improved the granularity of its showback: once tags were in place, they could allocate shared costs via pre‑defined business rules (CUBEs) and generate PowerBI dashboards for leaders. In short, automated tag policies and compliance reporting transformed opaque spend into chargeback-able data.

## GenAI Spending and Guardrails (Azure OpenAI example & FinOps Guidance)

Generative AI workloads can blow budgets if unchecked. One real-world example came from Corteva (an agribusiness, but with large-scale Azure usage). Their FinOps lead found that **Azure OpenAI Service** has no native tagging for API keys. Without tags, spend can’t be easily charged back. So they built a _token-allocation_ model: they tracked the total tokens consumed by each API key and assigned that percentage of the monthly bill to that key. Practically, they counted each user key’s successful token calls, computed each key’s token‑usage share, and multiplied by the workspace’s total spend. This let them estimate a dollar cost per API key for initial showback. It was “crawl-stage” FinOps – a lot of manual bookkeeping, but it exposed who was driving the Azure OpenAI spend. This case underscores the need for custom attribution when vendor tooling is limited.

More broadly, FinOps best practices stress setting hard quotas and alerts on GenAI usage. For example, the FinOps Foundation recommends _”set usage limits and quotas”_ on LLM APIs and _integrate anomaly detection_ into billing. In practice this means capping API calls per team or project and alerting if token consumption spikes unexpectedly. One guideline: trigger an alarm if token usage doubles absent any clear cause. Industry surveys confirm these fears – without guardrails “GenAI pilots can silently trigger runaway spend”. In fact, a recent FinOps report found 63% of teams now explicitly track AI spend, up from 32% last year, reflecting how easily unmetered GenAI can bust budgets. These examples show that _proper FinOps controls (quotas, labels, alerts)_ are vital whenever generative models are used in production.

## Measuring ROI and Business Value of GenAI

FinOps isn’t just about cuts — it’s about tracking value. Klarna (EU-based fintech) provides a clear example of GenAI ROI in action. After deploying an AI chat assistant for customer service, Klarna reported that _two-thirds_ of chats (≈2.3 million annual conversations) are now auto-handled by AI – equivalent to the work of about 700 agents. The AI cut average resolution time from 11 minutes down to under 2 minutes, greatly improving service speed. Crucially, Klarna projects these efficiencies will translate into a **$40 million boost to its 2024 profits**. These figures come from Klarna’s own published case (via a technology blog) and highlight how a business can quantify GenAI value in dollars saved or earned.

More broadly, industry data support these gains. A Google Cloud survey of hundreds of financial services leaders found that 90% of firms running GenAI in production saw at least _6% revenue lift_, and about 50% reported employee productivity roughly _doubling_ due to AI tools. While not specific to one company, this underscores that FinOps teams should build dashboards for GenAI projects not just to track costs but to compare them to clear business KPIs (time saved, revenue impact, etc.). In summary, ROI tracking for GenAI means pairing token usage and spend data with performance metrics, as Klarna’s example illustrates.

## Regulatory Compliance and Ongoing Cost Planning

FinOps must also account for regulatory overhead. In the EU, the new AI Act imposes sweeping requirements on AI projects (risk classification, documentation, oversight). Even before going live, teams must budget time and resources for compliance. According to FinOps-for-AI guidelines, companies should explicitly _“budget for compliance with emerging laws, including risk assessment and model documentation”_. In other words, achieving legal compliance (especially for high-risk or GPAI systems under the EU Act) is itself a line item in the cloud budget. Practically, FinOps roadmaps now include governance work: forming AI risk committees, cataloging models by use-case, and maintaining audit trails. The recent AI Act timeline (phased in 2025–2027) means these costs can’t be an afterthought. While we did not find a named fintech reporting exact compliance costs, expert commentary stresses that firms must integrate AI governance into their “Day-2” operational planning. In effect, FinOps teams extend budgeting from just runtime and development costs to also cover ongoing regulatory compliance work.

_Fig. AWS example – an AI-powered FinOps assistant built on Bedrock._ AWS demonstrated a multi‑agent cost-management app using Amazon Bedrock (Nova models). As shown, a Finance user logs into a web app (AWS Amplify/Cognito). The system then spawns multiple collaborating AI agents (e.g. a “Cost Analysis” agent, “Cost Optimization” agent) that invoke AWS Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor via Lambda. Each agent fetches real-time usage data (e.g. _get_cost_and_usage_, _list_recommendations_) to answer natural-language queries. This proof-of-concept illustrates how GenAI (AWS Nova) can automate financial insights – although it was an AWS-led example, it shows what an AI-enabled FinOps toolchain can look like. Real organizations may use this as inspiration to build or adopt AI assistants that monitor cloud spend, enforce budget policies, or recommend savings in natural language.
