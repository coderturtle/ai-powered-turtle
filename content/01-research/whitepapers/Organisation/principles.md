# üåç High-Level Principles

### 1. **Humans Stay Accountable**

Agents draft, propose, and accelerate ‚Äî but humans remain the signatories.

- _Analogy tie:_ Like double-entry books, agents record both sides, but controllers (humans) sign the accounts.
    

### 2. **Capacity Dividend ‚â† Headcount Reduction**

Productivity gains fuel **more product teams, experiments, and advisor support**, not job cuts.

- _Analogy tie:_ Joint-stock voyages meant more ships, not fewer sailors.
    

### 3. **Policy Lives in the Pipeline**

Rules, controls, and regulatory obligations are encoded as **policy-as-code** inside workflows.

- _Analogy tie:_ Clearinghouses embedded margin/risk checks in every trade.
    

### 4. **Evidence by Default**

Every agent action produces **traces, evals, redaction proofs, and provenance logs** for audit and learning.

- _Analogy tie:_ Custodians and registrars ‚Äî books & records by default.
    

### 5. **Prototype First, Scale with Proof**

We **prototype-in-a-day** to test value fast; we only scale once evidence passes **guardrails and evals**.

- _Analogy tie:_ Decimalisation/ticker tape ‚Äî small increments enabled faster discovery.
    

### 6. **Co-Design Across Business + Tech**

This is an **operating model transformation**, not a tech-only shift.

- _Analogy tie:_ Index funds blended finance, operations, regulation, and distribution.
    

### 7. **Career Evolution, Not Obsolescence**

Roles evolve into **Problem Framers, Agent Wranglers, Scenario Engineers, Evidence Leads**, etc.

- _Analogy tie:_ From floor traders to quants, from clerks to risk managers ‚Äî roles shift, they don‚Äôt vanish.

# üéØ Achievable Goals (2026‚Äì2027 Horizon)

### People & Culture

- **Agent Driver‚Äôs Licence L1‚ÄìL3** for Product, Ops, Advisors, and Engineers by end of 2026.
    
- Define **new role pathways** (Agent Wrangler, Scenario Engineer, Evidence Lead) and embed in HR frameworks by mid-2026.
    
- Run quarterly ‚Äú**Agent Town Halls**‚Äù where cross-functional wins are showcased.
    

### Process & Delivery

- **Prototype-in-a-Day** used by 50% of EU product pods by Q4-2026.
    
- **Agent-drafted BRDs/epics** piloted in at least 4 pods; target 30% reduction in requirement churn.
    
- Shared **golden pipelines with evals** in 80% of EU repos by end-2027.
    

### Business & Client Outcomes

- **Advisor Proposal Copilot** pilot in 2026 ‚Üí 15% faster time-to-proposal, with compliance exceptions ‚â§ baseline.
    
- **Onboarding/KYC Assistant** ‚Üí lift straight-through-processing (STP) rate by 20% by 2027.
    
- **Customer Support Copilot** ‚Üí +10% First Contact Resolution (FCR) and ‚Äì15% average handle time by 2027.
    

### Risk & Compliance

- **EU AI Act evidence packs** automatically generated for 70% of applicable pilots by mid-2027.
    
- **Zero critical safety breaches** across pilots (change-fail and policy violations within DORA thresholds).
    
- Maintain **audit-readiness** with traceable artifacts for all agent-enabled workflows.
    

### Platform & Shared Services

- **AgentOps/EvalOps v1** live by Q2-2026; includes LLM gateway, MCP registry, eval harness, and observability.
    
- Launch **Green-Beret Guild** (10‚Äì15 deep coders) by H2-2026.
    
- At least 3 **local service agents** live in shared services (IDP, Security, Ops) by end-2026.
    

### Scaling & Economics

- **EU:** Double the number of pods (from baseline) by end-2027 with no increase in change-fail rate.
    
- **US:** Deploy selective agents, target 10% reduction in unit cost-to-serve by 2027.
    
- Quarterly **Org Convergence Scorecard** shows business + tech adoption parity.
