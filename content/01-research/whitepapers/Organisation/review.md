# End-of-Year Self Review

**Role:** Head of Architecture & Platform Engineering — Europe (Global FS)  
**Rating Sought:** **Distinguished** (Exceeds Expectations; Top ~10%)

## Executive Summary

When I joined, Architecture in Europe was fragmented, reactive, and loosely coupled to Engineering. Over the past year I led a turnaround to a **structured, outcome-driven function** with clear governance, a shared product architecture view, and measurable improvements in delivery alignment and developer experience. In parallel, I stabilized and re-connected Platform Engineering relationships across regions, unblocked critical enterprise initiatives (GitHub migration, AI enablement on Amazon Bedrock and Claude Code), and co-authored an **international MarTech strategy** that reframes “marketing tech” as the backbone of an omni-channel customer experience. Feedback from delivery teams and enterprise partners consistently cites **material improvements in direction, collaboration, and trust**. I operated beyond Europe’s remit—representing **International** in enterprise forums, pulling requirements into discovery phases earlier, and creating repeatable patterns other regions are now reusing.

## Outcomes & Impact (Highlights)

### 1) Architecture Function Turnaround (from reactive to governed and strategic)

- **Launched Architecture Review Board (ARB)** with lightweight, consistent gates; standardized **ADRs** and integrated them with source control.  
    **Impact:** Shorter decision cycles; higher traceability; improved cross-team alignment.
    
- **Created an Architecture Jira backlog** and instituted **weekly architecture forums** focused on cross-cutting strategy (AI, event-driven, agentic patterns, data).  
    **Impact:** Clear work visibility, fewer ad-hoc escalations, and better prioritization against business outcomes.
    
- **Introduced a curated Product Architecture for Europe** (capabilities → products → product families).  
    **Impact:** A shared vocabulary with Product & Engineering to reason about target states, investment choices, and tech debt.
    
- **Published Architecture Strategy & Target States** (API-first, event-driven, AI-ready).  
    **Impact:** Shift from tactical fixes to guided, north-star decisions; reduced rework and “design by ticket.”
    

### 2) Enterprise & International Influence (connecting discovery to delivery)

- **Joined US Chief Architect working groups** (incl. **genAI WG**) to insert **International requirements in discovery/design**, not after the fact.  
    **Impact:** Fewer late surprises; patterns built once and adopted globally.
    
- **Shifted cross-team architecture forum times** to include EU; hosted **guest enterprise architects** in EU forums.  
    **Impact:** Stronger community of practice; higher EU engagement in enterprise initiatives.
    

### 3) Platform Engineering Leadership (from strained to collaborative)

- Inherited a **dysfunctional situation (incl. PIP)** and rebuilt trust across US/EU platform teams.  
    **Impact:** Issues now routed and resolved collaboratively; improved tone and velocity.
    
- **IAM service improvement**: consolidated SI feedback, raised systemic issues, partnered with new EU IAM leadership on fixes.  
    **Impact:** Addresses a key driver of negative DX survey results; early indicators show reduced friction and faster resolution.
    
- **ETR Tokenisation pilot (UKPI)**: partnered closely to progress the initiative.  
    **Impact:** Foundational pattern for PII protection and compliant data sharing.
    

### 4) Enterprise GitHub Migration (IST Europe + GIFS)

- Drove structure, support, and **blocker removal** (e.g., **Kong credentials workflow** issue) to hit **Sept/Oct timelines**.  
    **Impact:** Smooth transition, reduced migration risk, and consistent developer tooling across regions.
    

### 5) AI Enablement for International (Bedrock & Claude Code)

- **Shepherded Bedrock enablement** (and **Claude Code**) end-to-end with CTO/EDO, Legal, Risk, and Compliance—explaining technical controls and aligning with regulatory requirements.  
    **Impact:** Safe, approved access to strategic AI capabilities—now powering hackathons, prototypes, and early productivity gains.
    
- Co-created guardrails (authN/Z pass-through, logging/audit, data handling) aligning with International’s **risk posture**.  
    **Impact:** “Prove-it-then-promote-it” pipeline for AI use cases vs. one-off exceptions.
    

### 6) International MarTech Strategy (from tool talk to CX platform narrative)

- Partnered with Enterprise Marketing & EU business to define a **long-term International strategy** that positions MarTech as an **omni-channel CX enabler**, not a silo.  
    **Impact:** Executive alignment and momentum—**more progress this year than the previous five**; reusable roadmap co-authored with Australia and Americas perspectives.
    
- Delivered a **business narrative** tying capabilities to outcomes (personalisation, lifecycle engagement, measurement).  
    **Impact:** Clear investment case and phased adoption path; avoids fragmented, region-only tooling.
    

### 7) Talent, Mentoring & Learning Culture

- **WILS mentor** and informal mentor to EU engineers; regular coaching to help new architects grow while meeting delivery expectations.  
    **Impact:** Measurable confidence and consistency uptick across the team; improved retention signals.
    
- Contributed to **L&D curriculum** for app-dev upskilling on AI; **mobilised International pilots** to shape content with real feedback.  
    **Impact:** Curriculum better reflects real-world needs; International has a seat at the table.
    
- **Delivered a successful AI hackathon** coordinated with Bedrock availability.  
    **Impact:** Rapid ideation to working prototypes; tangible momentum and skills lift.

## Risks Managed & How

- **Change fatigue & process aversion:** Kept ARB/ADR **lightweight and value-centric**; demonstrated time savings and fewer escalations.
    
- **AI compliance risk:** Embedded Legal/Risk/Compliance early; **auditable controls** (auth, logging, data handling) and “**prove-it-then-promote-it**” guardrails.
    
- **Resource constraints:** Prioritised **reusable patterns** and cross-region leverage to multiply impact without headcount increases.

## Growth & Leadership Behaviours

- **Ownership:** I took responsibility for outcomes **across** Architecture and Platform—even where accountability was diffuse.
    
- **Earn Trust:** Transparent decision logs (ADRs), inclusive forums, visible backlog.
    
- **Think Big & Invent/Simplify:** Agentic/AI patterns, event-driven targets, and minimal-friction governance.
    
- **Develop the Team:** Structured mentoring, actionable feedback, and space for architects new to role to grow.
