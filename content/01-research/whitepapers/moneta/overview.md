# Overview & Objectives

Moneta is a visionary B2C personal investing platform designed for individuals across Europe and the UK. It leverages advanced _agentic AI_ to act as a proactive financial guide for users, providing personalized investment strategies while ensuring strict compliance with GDPR, FCA, and EU financial regulations. This section provides a high-level overview of Moneta's goals and the guiding principles behind its modular architecture.

## Platform Vision and Key Objectives

Moneta’s architecture is driven by clear objectives that balance innovation with trust:

- **Personalized Guidance** – Empower users with AI-driven, tailor-made investment advice and autonomous portfolio management, offering insights traditionally available to wealthier investors.
- **Proactive Financial Agent** – Utilize agentic AI that can _perceive, reason, act, and learn_ on behalf of users&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, delivering real-time recommendations and automated actions (with user consent) rather than just reactive responses.
- **Seamless Multi-Channel UX** – Provide a unified and intuitive user experience across web, mobile, and conversational interfaces, ensuring accessibility and consistency regardless of device or platform.
- **Security & Compliance by Design** – Embed privacy, data protection, and regulatory compliance into every layer of the system (from data storage to AI decision-making), ensuring adherence to GDPR, FCA guidelines for robo-advice, and other EU financial regulations. Users should feel their data is safe and that advice is trustworthy and compliant.
- **Scalability & Reliability** – Architect for high performance and growth, so the platform can accommodate millions of users, spikes in market activity, and future expansion to new features or markets without major redesign.
- **Modularity & Future-Proofing** – Use a modular, service-oriented design that allows components (e.g., AI engines, compliance modules) to be updated or replaced as technology and regulations evolve, prolonging the platform’s relevance.

These objectives shape Moneta’s architecture, ensuring the system is not only _innovative_ but also _resilient_ and _user-centric_. The following sections detail each aspect of the architecture, from front-end to infrastructure, highlighting how they fulfill these goals.

## High-Level Architecture Overview

Moneta’s overall architecture follows a layered, modular approach. At a high level, it consists of multi-channel front-end clients, a robust integration layer (API gateway and orchestration), a suite of microservices in the back-end (including the AI-driven advisory engine), and a secure data management layer. The system integrates with external financial data sources and services while maintaining strict security controls. The diagram below illustrates the core components and their interactions:

> **Moneta** high-level architecture shows:  
> - Multi-channel user interfaces (Web, Mobile, Voice/Chat) connected via an API Gateway.  
> - A cluster of microservices for core domains: Portfolio Management, Trading, AI Advisory, Compliance, etc.  
> - A data layer with dedicated stores for user data, financial data, and analytics.  
> - External integrations (e.g., banking APIs, market data feeds) funneled through a secure integration layer.  
> - Underlying cloud infrastructure providing scalability across EU/UK regions.

All components are designed to work together seamlessly. For example, when a user interacts via the mobile app, the request flows through the API Gateway to relevant back-end services (like fetching their portfolio from **Portfolio Service** and getting AI-driven insights from **AI Advisory Service**). The **Compliance Service** continuously monitors activities and data flows, ensuring everything stays within regulatory bounds. Data is stored in appropriate databases (user profiles and PII in a secure SQL store, financial data in optimized stores, and aggregated data in a data lake for AI training and analytics).

**In summary,** Moneta’s architecture marries cutting-edge AI with solid architectural fundamentals. This overview has outlined the platform’s vision and high-level design. In the following sections, each layer and component of Moneta is examined in detail, including the front-end design, back-end microservices, data strategy, AI capabilities, and the critical cross-cutting concerns of security, compliance, and operations.
