# 🚀 2025 “Future-of-FinTech” Global Hackathon  
*Where bright minds meet bold tech to redefine financial services*

Artificial Intelligence models that learn in minutes, blockchains that settle in seconds, quantum chips that will one-day crack today’s “unbreakable” codes—technology is moving faster than ever, and so must we. To spark the ideas that will keep our company out in front, we’re hosting our first **Future-of-FinTech Hackathon**, running **simultaneously across three hubs**:

| Region | Local kick-off | Demo day & regional final |

## 🎯 What We’re Hacking On

Think of a product, service or internal capability that will give us a competitive edge in **2026-2030** by harnessing at least one of these front-edge enablers:

| Tech catalyst | Inspiration starters (not exhaustive!) |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Machine Learning / Gen-AI** | Hyper-personalised wealth coaching, real-time fraud self-defence, “explainable credit” scorecards |
| **Decentralised Web & Blockchain** | Tokenised deposits, programmable trade finance, cross-border settlement in \< 10 seconds |
| **Quantum-ready Security & Analytics** | Post-quantum cryptography playbooks, portfolio optimisation using quantum annealing |
| **Ambient / Embedded Finance** | Voice-first banking in cars, invisible BNPL for B2B supply chains |
| **Data Ethics & Responsible AI** | Bias-auditing dashboards, privacy-preserving synthetic-data marketplaces |

*If your concept bridges tech & business value—and makes customers or colleagues say “wow, that should exist”—you’re on the right track.*
