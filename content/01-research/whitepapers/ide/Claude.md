Below is a **‚Äúzero ‚Üí hero‚Äù playbook** for turning Anthropic Claude into a _super-charged_ development companion, then applying the workflow to build the **AI Act Journey Assistant** sample project. I‚Äôve blended the latest official docs with community-proven tricks so you can ramp up fast and still look like a wizard in front of your team.

## 1 ¬∑ First-time setup (‚âà 10 min)

|Step|What to do|Why / citation|
|---|---|---|
|**1.1 Sign up & keys**|Create or log in at **console.anthropic.com**, generate an **API key** (Settings ‚ñ∏ API keys).|Needed for CLI & IDE auth ([Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/home "Home - Anthropic"))|
|**1.2 Install CLI**|`bash\nnpm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code\n`|The `claude` CLI is the core agentic tool ([Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart "Quickstart - Anthropic"))|
|**1.3 Bootstrap a repo**|`bash\ngh repo create amazing-ai-act\ncd amazing-ai-act\ngit init\nclaude /init # creates CLAUDE.md & settings\n`|Seeds project config & a starter `CLAUDE.md` ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices "Claude Code Best Practices \ Anthropic"))|
|**1.4 IDE integration**|Install **‚ÄúClaude Code for VS Code‚Äù** from the Marketplace or run it once in the VS Code terminal‚Äîauto-detect installs the extension.|In-editor diff view, shortcuts, context awareness ([marketplace.visualstudio.com](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code "Claude Code for VSCode - Visual Studio Marketplace"))|

## 2 ¬∑ Tune your environment like a pro

### 2.1 `CLAUDE.md` ‚Äì your project‚Äôs memory palace

Add quick-hit docs (build commands, style rules, architecture links). Claude auto-ingests it every session, so iteratively refine it and ask Claude to update it for you. ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices "Claude Code Best Practices \ Anthropic"))

### 2.2 Allowed-tool hygiene

Keep risky actions gated. Use `/permissions` to whitelist only what‚Äôs safe (e.g., `git status`). Grant write perms sparingly‚Äîcommon community mishap is mass-add commits. ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices "Claude Code Best Practices \ Anthropic"))

### 2.3 Slash-command templates

Store repeat workflows in `.claude/commands/`. Example `deploy-dev.md`:

```
---
Run an end-to-end deploy to dev.
steps:
  - run "npm test"
  - run "terraform plan -out=plan.out"
  - run "terraform apply plan.out"
```

Triggers with `/deploy-dev`, saving dozens of tokens every day.

### 2.4 Model-Context Protocol (MCP) servers

If you need a vector DB or browser automation, drop a `.mcp.json` pointer; Claude will treat external tools as first-class citizens. ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices "Claude Code Best Practices \ Anthropic"))

## 4 ¬∑ Day-to-day workflows for a senior manager / hands-on architect

|Scenario|Shortcut prompt|
|---|---|
|üóÇ **Backlog grooming**|`/story-map docs/prd.md granularity:medium` ‚Äì auto-splits PRD into Epics & Issues.|
|üèó **Architecture brief**|‚ÄúGenerate C4 and ADRs for the new streaming pipeline; store in `docs/architecture/`.‚Äù|
|üìã **Exec summary**|‚ÄúSummarise today‚Äôs incident Slack thread into an exec-friendly status (<200 words).‚Äù|
|üí° **Workshop slides**|‚ÄúDraft 5 slide bullets explaining EU AI Act impact for product leaders; use conversational tone.‚Äù|
|üí∞ **Cost spike**|‚ÄúCreate a cost-forecast table for our LLM endpoints given 10k, 100k, 1 M calls/month.‚Äù|

## 5 ¬∑ Sample project: **AI Act Journey Assistant**

> **Mission**: Web app that classifies use-cases against the EU AI Act, explains risk & controls, and exports an audit pack.

### 5.1 Kick-off (IDE agent mode)

```bash
claude "Create a PRD to automate EU AI Act classification for internal teams."
```

_Claude writes `docs/prd.md` with goals, personas, success metrics._

### 5.2 Backlog & branches

```bash
claude "/create-backlog docs/prd.md granularity:medium"
gh issue list   # verify tickets
```

Assign boilerplate tasks (e.g., ‚Äúcreate FastAPI skeleton‚Äù) to **@github-copilot** _or_ run:

```bash
claude "Implement the FastAPI skeleton and open a PR named backend-skeleton"
```

### 5.3 Architecture pass

```
claude "Produce C4 context & container diagrams + ADRs; save under docs/architecture."
```

### 5.4 Classifier & RAG engine

```bash
claude "Embed docs/regulation/eu_ai_act.md into a local SQLite vectordb; create `/app/classifier.py` with a retrieve-then-classify pipeline."
```

### 5.5 UX flow

In VS Code chat (agent mode):

```
Design a 3-step React journey: 
1. Use-case form 
2. Risk results with explanations 
3. Download audit pack
```

### 5.6 Audit pack export

```
claude "Create a PDF generator with pdfkit; endpoint /export that bundles risk summary + recommended controls."
```

### 5.7 Security & FinOps check-ins

```
/threat-model web app high-level
/cost-estimate openai_calls=2000/mo aws_lambda_invocations=5000/mo
```

### 5.8 CI/CD & docs

```bash
claude "Write GitHub Actions workflow: lint ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy to AWS Amplify on main."
claude "Update README with dev-container setup."
```

**Result**: In one afternoon you‚Äôll have a repo containing code, CI, diagrams and an auto-generated PDF ready for Risk/Legal review‚Äîwhile you focused on the big decisions, not the boilerplate.
