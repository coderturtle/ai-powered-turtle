# Skill Evolution

Enduring engineering skills like systems thinking, critical analysis, and strategic design remain crucial. However, automatable skills such as boilerplate coding and low-level testing are increasingly handled by AI. Emerging AI-native roles include:

- **Prompt Engineers:** Optimize prompts and interactions for generative models.
- **GenOps Leads:** Ensure robust operationalization of AI models.
- **AI Architects:** Design comprehensive AI-integrated architectures.
- **AI Code Curators:** Validate, refine, and integrate AI-generated code.

Companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Replit exemplify these shifts, embedding AI roles within core development teams.
