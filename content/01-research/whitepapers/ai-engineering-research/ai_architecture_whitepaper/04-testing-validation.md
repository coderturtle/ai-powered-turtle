# Testing & Validation

AI enhances software testing through hypothesis-driven testing, real-time design verification, and architectural observability. Techniques such as AI-driven simulation, model validation, bias detection, and continuous monitoring help organizations maintain high-quality, compliant AI systems. AI-based testing reduces manual effort and increases reliability by integrating continuous validation directly into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
