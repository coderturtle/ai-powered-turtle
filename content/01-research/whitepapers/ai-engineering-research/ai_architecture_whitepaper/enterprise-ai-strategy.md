# Enterprise AI Strategy

## Introduction
In the highly regulated fintech sector, AI is poised to transform software architecture and engineering practices. An EU-based asset manager with brokerage, advisory, and wealthtech offerings must adapt its enterprise architecture to be AI-ready in order to leverage advanced analytics and AI-driven services while maintaining compliance. This section outlines a comprehensive strategy for modernizing a fintech platform to integrate AI capabilities at scale. We present a reference architecture combining AWS and open-source components, discuss an AI-native software development lifecycle (SDLC) versus legacy approaches, and detail the tooling, workflows, and regulatory considerations (GDPR, EU AI Act, DORA, etc.) for a successful AI-enabled transformation. The goal is to enable software architects and engineering leaders to infuse AI into their systems in a secure, compliant, and scalable manner, driving innovation in customer experiences and operational efficiency.

## Conclusion
The enterprise AI strategy outlined above provides a reference blueprint for infusing AI into a fintech platform in a way that is innovative yet controlled. By leveraging AWS managed services and open-source tools, the strategy delivers a concrete toolchain for MLOps, embedding critical practices for security, observability, and continuous delivery while maintaining compliance with GDPR, the EU AI Act, and DORA.
