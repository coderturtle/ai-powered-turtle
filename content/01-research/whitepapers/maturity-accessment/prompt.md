## üíº Deep Research Prompt: Architecture Maturity & Strategic Platform Vision

You are the **Head of Architecture** at a UK-based personal investing platform. Your company is transitioning from **startup mode** (where business viability and speed took precedence) into a **scale-up phase** focused on operational resilience, regulatory robustness, and AI-readiness.

This deep research prompt initiates a comprehensive **architecture maturity assessment**. You are writing for the **Executive Leadership Team** and need to deliver a **diagnosis of architectural risks**, a **reference target state**, and a **roadmap for action** that balances agility, compliance, and innovation.

---

### üéØ Objectives

1. Conduct an **architecture maturity assessment** across core enterprise architecture dimensions (integration, modularity, data ownership, governance, resilience, scalability, observability).
    
2. Identify and map key architectural risks and legacy debt resulting from the startup phase.
    
3. Design a **target state architecture** that is:
    
    - Modular, event-driven, and domain-oriented
        
    - AI-ready (GenAI + Agentic)
        
    - Streaming-native (Kafka, Flink, Iceberg, Tableflow)
        
    - Omnichannel (Web, Mobile, API, Agents)
        
    - Compliance-aware (FCA, GDPR, EU AI Act)
        
4. Define a realistic **roadmap** to shift from the current to the future state.
    
5. Explore the use of **FCA‚Äôs regulatory sandbox** to pilot compliant, innovative services.

### üß± Context & Pain Points

The platform has grown organically with startup-stage trade-offs. Key issues include:

- ‚ùå No common **integration/anti-corruption layer**, increasing the risk of cascading failures.
    
- ‚ùå Over-reliance on a **third-party record keeper** as golden data source‚Äîno control or fallback.
    
- ‚ùå Extreme **vendor lock-in** due to custom build and outsourced data ownership.
    
- ‚ùå **Inaccessible, non-democratised data** ‚Äî not usable for AI, ML, or rapid analytics.
    
- ‚ùå Lack of **bounded modularity** ‚Äî tight coupling across layers slows innovation.
    
- ‚ùå Missing **governance and strategic design discipline** ‚Äî UI-driven decisions miss backend impact.
    
- ‚ùå No consistent process for defining **business value, TCO, ROI**.
    
- ‚ùå **No target state architecture** ‚Äî reactive development cycle accumulates debt.

### üß† Research Questions

- What are the architectural capabilities we must mature (based on TOGAF, BIAN, or custom matrix)?
    
- How can we migrate to a **streaming-native, modular architecture** built on Confluent‚Äôs stack?
    
- What are the specific architectural elements required to **democratise data**?
    
- What front-end and back-end integration models support omnichannel + agent interfaces?
    
- How can agentic/LLM-based architectures be layered into core investing workflows?
    
- What modular governance and developer experience capabilities must be introduced?
    
- What architectural changes best prepare us for **FCA Consumer Duty**, **GDPR**, and **EU AI Act** obligations?
