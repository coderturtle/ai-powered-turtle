# üß† Deep Research Prompt

## üéØ Purpose

You are the **Head of Architecture** within a **financial services firm**. One of your core lines of business is a **personal investing platform** that is:

- **Fully hosted on AWS**
- **Built on a third-party record keeping platform**, which is tightly coupled
- **Critically dependent** on this platform for:
  - User onboarding
  - Investment monitoring
  - Trading and order management
  - Back-office operations

This research investigates the **feasibility, complexity, and cost** of implementing a **cross-cloud resiliency solution** by deploying a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** of your platform in **Microsoft Azure**, and highlights architectural limitations and third-party constraints.

---

## üß± Current State Architecture Overview

- Your platform‚Äôs business-critical workflows are **unavailable during third-party outages**.
- You receive a **daily data feed** of customer account info, which allows you to display **stale investment data** only during outages.
- The **back office team** depends heavily on the third party's UI and APIs.
- Your integration is **tightly coupled**, with no decoupling or independent fallback capability.

---

## üîç Research Objectives

### 1. **MVP Azure Build Proposal**
- Define what a **minimum viable implementation** of your platform would look like on Azure:
  - Core user-facing services
  - Critical API layers
  - Minimal UX fallback features
  - Operational support tooling

### 2. **Data Backup & Sync Strategy**
- Evaluate two backup strategies:
  - **Near real-time sync** of operational data
  - **Daily batch synchronization** of third-party data feeds
- Identify suitable AWS ‚Üí Azure replication methods (e.g., Kinesis to Event Hubs, S3 to Blob Storage, RDS ‚Üí Cosmos DB/Azure SQL)
- Analyze data transfer egress and ingress **costs**, latency, and **compliance risks**

### 3. **Engineering & DevOps Investment**
- Estimate **engineering effort and cost** to:
  - Build and maintain parallel pipelines and infrastructure in Azure
  - Maintain multi-cloud CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code
  - Integrate Azure-native observability (e.g., App Insights, Azure Monitor) alongside AWS tooling
- Consider identity and access management (IAM) duplication, secrets management, monitoring alerts, and container registry duplication

### 4. **Multi-Cloud Operational Complexity**
- Highlight long-term complexity in:
  - Managing shared state across clouds
  - Keeping infrastructure versions aligned
  - Data consistency challenges
  - Deployment coordination and rollback across regions
- Evaluate **observability trade-offs**, and dual telemetry setup across cloud platforms

## üìâ Third-Party Platform Risk & Decoupling

### 5. **Limitations of Cross-Cloud Without Decoupling**
- Analyze what **resiliency gaps remain** when your third-party record keeper:
  - Goes offline or becomes unreliable
  - Has stale, missing, or incorrect data
  - Limits access via APIs or service contracts
- Show that **cross-cloud is ineffective** in mitigating full outages of this vendor

### 6. **Design for Decoupling**
- Propose **short-term and long-term options** to decouple:
  - Build **anti-corruption layer** (ACL) to isolate 3rd party models
  - Introduce **event-driven cache** or **data lake** owned by your platform
  - Extend your daily data feed to a **more frequent sync**
  - Consider **shadow write** patterns to regain partial ownership

### 7. **RACI & Risk Table for Current State**
- Create a **RACI matrix** for responsibilities between:
  - Your team
  - 3rd party vendor
  - Internal ops
  - Cloud providers (AWS & Azure)
- Annotate with risk mitigation gaps and **cost of failure**
- Provide a **qualitative risk map** showing what‚Äôs within vs. outside your control

## üí∞ Cost Estimation Framework (High-Level)

Break down **investment areas** for Azure MVP:

| Area                        | Cost Range (Est.) | Notes |
|----------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Infrastructure Build       | ¬£150k‚Äì¬£300k       | Core platform setup, networking, IAM, containers |
| Data Sync & Backup Pipelines | ¬£75k‚Äì¬£200k        | Kinesis/EventBridge replication or ETL batch |
| DevOps & Tooling Integration | ¬£50k‚Äì¬£100k        | GitHub Actions, IaC reuse, dual cloud setup |
| Observability/Monitoring   | ¬£25k‚Äì¬£75k         | Dual telemetry, alerting integration |
| Engineering Overhead (Year 1) | ¬£250k‚Äì¬£400k       | Onboarding, documentation, CI/CD, reviews |
| **Total (Range)**          | **¬£550k‚Äì¬£1.075M** | Rough high-level for MVP scope |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: These are rough indicative estimates. A full feasibility assessment and solution design phase is required to accurately scope costs, risks, and architectural viability.

## üìå Suggested Deliverables

- Architecture decision log (ADR) for cross-cloud MVP
- Comparative risk analysis of:
  - Single-cloud with vendor lock-in vs
  - Cross-cloud with coupled vendor
- Design decision log (DDL) for third-party decoupling strategy
- RACI Matrix (Current vs. Future State)
- Roadmap slide deck (MVP to long-term multi-cloud strategy)

---

## üß≠ Summary Recommendations

1. **Start with a focused Azure MVP** covering critical customer-facing flows and batch-based data sync.
2. **Run a feasibility analysis** for decoupling the third-party integration as a parallel workstream.
3. Prioritize ownership of your **customer data layer** to unlock true resilience benefits.
4. Socialize with infosec/risk as a **resilience posture improvement**, not just infrastructure expansion.
5. Consider staging this as a **resilience pilot** to unlock incremental value with budget control.
