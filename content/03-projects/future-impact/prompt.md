# 🧠 Deep Research Prompt

## 🏛️ Purpose

You are the **Head of Architecture** at a large fintech company. Your mission is to lead a comprehensive research initiative to define your organization's **AI Strategy** across technical, organizational, and operational dimensions. This strategy should prepare your business and engineering units for the transformational impacts of AI over the short, medium, and long term.

The final output should be **executive-readable**, technically grounded, and include **interactive, diagram-rich content** suitable for **Obsidian vaults and Quartz sites**.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

### 1. 🧩 AI-Driven Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- Investigate how AI tools like *vibe coding*, *deep research*, and *AI pairing* will alter architectural and engineering workflows.
- Identify new SDLC patterns emerging from AI augmentation.
- Describe bottlenecks removed and new ones introduced.

**Artifacts**:
- Before/after SDLC flows (Mermaid)
- Day-in-the-life scenarios for engineers and architects
- AI prompt packs for code, design, and review phases

---

### 2. 🧑‍🚀 Emerging Roles and Skillsets
- Define new roles required in an AI-native architecture organization (e.g., LLMOps, PromptOps, Agent Designers).
- Highlight which roles/skills may decline.
- Create a mapping of skills to high-leverage value creation.

**Artifacts**:
- Role evolution matrix
- Prompt pack: "What role should I grow into?"

---

### 3. 📚 Upskilling & Learning Strategy
- Create learning journeys aligned with the emerging AI skills.
- Define team training pathways based on maturity and role.
- Include self-serve and cohort-based training options.

**Artifacts**:
- AI skills roadmap
- Recommended resources by role and level
- Prompt pack: "Design my AI learning plan"

---

### 4. 🧭 Strategic Roadmap: Short, Mid, Long Term
- Define transformation goals for 6, 12, and 36 months.
- Identify key dependencies and decision gates (e.g., compliance, infrastructure readiness).

**Artifacts**:
- Mermaid Gantt or Kanban-style timeline
- Key milestones and OKRs
- Prompt pack: “Assess our AI maturity phase”

---

### 5. 🏗️ Investment Focus Across Architecture
- Identify existing patterns that will be de-emphasized or repurposed.
- Highlight where to invest (e.g., orchestration layers, agent frameworks, RAG pipelines).
- Determine ROI potential across architecture layers.

**Artifacts**:
- ROI vs. complexity charts
- Capability heatmaps
- Prompt pack: "What will yield the best ROI?"

---

### 6. 🧱 Reference Architectures with C4 Diagrams

#### A. 🧠 Data Architecture
- Data mesh/lakehouse hybrid with RAG and feedback loops
- Secure, explainable democratization

#### B. ⚙️ Platform / Middleware
- ModelOps and AgentOrchestration layers
- Domain gateways and AI-aware service meshes

#### C. 🌐 Omnichannel Experience Layer
- Conversational-first frontends
- Adaptive UI/UX powered by AI

**Artifacts**:
- C4 Mermaid diagrams (for each layer)
- AI-native deltas
- Prompt packs per architecture layer

---

### 7. ⚒️ What Changes with AI
- Define how traditional architectural approaches need to shift.
- Emphasize distributed cognition, fluid boundaries, and co-design with AI agents.

**Artifacts**:
- “Before/After” design pattern catalog
- Decision-making with AI guide
- Prompt pack: "How would I solve X differently with AI?"

---

### 8. 📆 Day-in-the-Life Scenarios
- Engineer (mid-level)
- Staff/Principal Architect
- Tech Lead/Product Engineer

**Artifacts**:
- Timeline illustrations (hour by hour)
- Toolkits and rituals
- Prompt pack: “Design my AI-enhanced workday”

---

### 9. 🧩 Org Structure for the AI Era

- Define permissioning, lineage, and accountability
- Tailor strategy for personalization, risk, compliance, and analytics

**Artifacts**:
- Data governance blueprint
- AI-aware data democratization framework
- Prompt pack: “Can I safely use this data for AI?”

---

## 📦 Output Format

- Obsidian-compatible Markdown (`.md`)
- Quartz-ready (with proper frontmatter and tag linking)
- Mermaid diagrams for architecture, workflows, org charts
- Prompt packs embedded inline in collapsible sections
- Modular structure for reuse across slides, wikis, and blog posts

---
