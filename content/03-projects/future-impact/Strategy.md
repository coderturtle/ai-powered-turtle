## Executive Summary

Our 2026–2030 Technology Strategy is a **blueprint for innovation and growth** that will keep our €800 bn AUM financial-services group **ahead of competitors, delighting customers and empowering employees** in a fast-changing market. Grounded in our mission to _“turn savers into lifelong investors,”_ this strategy outlines how technology will drive business value through personalized, low-cost investing at scale, while ensuring we remain nimble, secure, and compliant. Key elements include:

- **Customer-Centric Digital Transformation:** We will radically improve omnichannel customer experience across web, mobile, voice, and emerging channels. A new AI-powered personal investing assistant and seamless hand-offs between self-service and human advisors will boost customer satisfaction and trust. Personalized education, insights, and products will help build financial literacy and long-term engagement.
    
- **Empowered Advisors & Employees:** Our workforce will be supported by modern tools like a unified advisor desktop, AI copilots for software development and customer support, and low-code platforms to rapidly build solutions. By streamlining workflows and providing a 360° customer view, we expect significant productivity gains and better service delivery.
    
- **Composable “Lego Block” Architecture:** To stay nimble and innovation-ready, we are embracing a modular, API-first architecture. Legacy systems will be incrementally replaced or wrapped with microservices, domain-driven APIs, and real-time data streams. A cloud-native platform (primary AWS with Azure integration for CRM & productivity suites) will ensure scalability and agility, with ~90% of applications in cloud by 2028 (from ~60% today, similar to Fidelity’s trajectory).
    
- **AI & Data as Core Capabilities:** We will infuse Machine Learning and Generative AI across the business – from personalized advice and adaptive fraud detection to automated coding and decision-making agents. An enterprise data mesh with a streaming backbone (Kafka/Pulsar) will feed an “AI-ready” feature store to turn raw data into real-time insights. This data-driven approach will unlock new services (e.g. predictive next-best offers, intelligent risk management) and drive efficiency (AI-assisted operations).
    
- **Digital Assets & Identity for New Opportunities:** We will leverage blockchain and decentralized technologies to simplify fund distribution and create new products. Tokenized funds and on-chain settlement promise instant, 24/7 transactions and broader investor access – tokenized fund AUM could reach 1% of global fund assets (~$600B) by 2030. We’ll partner in the DeFi space (within regulatory guardrails) and adopt self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) to streamline onboarding with reusable KYC credentials and privacy-preserving trust.
    
- **Security, Compliance & Future-Readiness:** All initiatives will be underpinned by robust security and compliance. We adopt privacy-by-design and zero-trust architectures, ensuring strict data governance (essential in an AI-driven world per emerging EU AI Act rules). A proactive posture on upcoming risks – such as preparing for quantum-vulnerable cryptography to be retired by 2030 – will safeguard the firm’s and clients’ assets in the long term.
    

This strategy is **actionable and phased**. It details immediate “Now” investments (2026 quick wins like cloud consolidation, data platform build-out, AI pilots), “Next” mid-term accelerators (2027–28 scaling of AI, platform rollout, digital identity launch), and visionary “Beyond” bets (2029–30 agentic AI automation, quantum computing pilots, fully decentralized services). Each initiative is tied to clear business outcomes (e.g. +X% in customer Net Promoter Score, –Y% operating cost, faster time-to-market) and has owner accountability. Key milestones and governance checkpoints will ensure we stay on track or course-correct quickly.

In summary, this technology blueprint enables our business mission by marrying **world-class customer experiences, a flexible and innovative architecture, and a culture of data-driven continuous improvement.** It positions us to not only respond to industry disruption but lead it – much like digital-native competitors (we benchmark firms like Fidelity for scale and Revolut for agility). By 2030, we aim to have a **secure, modular financial platform that seamlessly blends human and digital services**, turning our organization into a lifelong partner for investors and a magnet for talent.

## Elevator Pitch

In the next 5 years, we will **transform our technology platform into a cloud-native, AI-enabled “Lego block” architecture** that powers seamless omnichannel investing experiences. Savers will get **personalized advice and education powered by AI**, delivered consistently across app, web, voice, and even chat with an investing GPT. Our employees and advisors will be **augmented by AI copilots and a unified data view**, boosting productivity and allowing high-touch service where it matters. We’ll unlock new opportunities by **embracing blockchain (tokenized funds, instant settlement) and self-sovereign digital identity**, while rigorously managing risk with built-in security and compliance (from post-quantum encryption to AI model governance). This strategy keeps us **nimble, modular, and innovation-ready** – integrating the best of AWS and Microsoft’s ecosystems – so we can **lead the market with agility like a fintech, at the scale of an incumbent**. It’s about delighting customers, empowering employees, and changing the game in how the world invests, all by 2030.

## Vision & Guiding Principles

**Vision:** _Become the world’s most trusted and innovative investing platform – a digital ecosystem of financial “building blocks” that customers and partners can easily assemble to meet any investing need. We seamlessly blend human expertise with AI-driven personalization, turning every saver into a confident lifelong investor._

To achieve this vision, we adopt several guiding principles:

1. **Customer-Centric & Omnichannel:** Design everything from the outside-in. Provide a unified, intuitive experience across all channels (web, mobile, voice, chat, advisor) with seamless hand-offs. Every customer interaction should feel personal and frictionless, regardless of device or touchpoint. Measurement: customer satisfaction (NPS) and consistency across channels.
    
2. **API-First, Composable Architecture (“Lego” blocks):** Build and deploy technology as modular services that can be reused and recombined. Domain-driven APIs and micro-frontends will encapsulate business capabilities into _packaged building blocks_. This **Lego-style IT** allows faster innovation and integration – internally and with partners – keeping the organization agile.
    
3. **Cloud-Smart & Poly-Cloud:** Leverage cloud to the fullest for scalability, resiliency, and speed, while avoiding vendor lock-in. We are primarily AWS-first for infrastructure (tapping its rich services), with strategic use of Azure for MS Dynamics 365 CRM, Office productivity and Microsoft’s emerging AI studios (Copilot). Our cloud approach follows Fidelity’s example of consolidating on core platforms and reusing common services. By 2028, <40% of legacy tech remains, and >90% workloads on cloud. Use hybrid cloud only for true needs (e.g. data residency).
    
4. **Data-Driven & AI-Enabled:** Treat data as a strategic asset – **real-time, accessible, and AI-ready**. Implement a **data mesh** with domain-owned data products and a streaming backbone (Kafka/Pulsar) for event-driven everything. Invest in an enterprise feature store to feed ML models with quality data in real-time. All decision processes should be augmented by AI, from personalized customer offers to internal process automation. We prioritize use of ML/AI where it tangibly improves outcomes (personalization lift, risk detection, cost reduction).
    
5. **Security & Privacy by Design:** Bake in security, compliance, and resilience from the start. Adopt zero-trust architecture (continuous verification of users/devices), and assume every API and microservice is an attack surface. Use encryption end-to-end (and plan for **post-quantum cryptography** by 2030). Comply with data privacy laws (GDPR, etc.) via strong data governance and minimizing sensitive data sharing (e.g. using techniques like privacy-preserving analytics and **zero-knowledge proofs** to verify identities without exposing data). _No trade-off between innovation and trust: we do both._
    
6. **Innovation Culture & Engineering Excellence:** Cultivate a culture that empowers experimentation and rapid iteration, akin to a fintech startup. Encourage continuous learning (like Fidelity’s “Learning Tuesdays” practice of dedicating time for upskilling) to keep teams updated on AI, blockchain, etc. Embrace DevOps and GitOps automation for fast, safe deployments. We use metrics like deployment frequency and lead time as KPIs. Also, **Developer Experience is paramount** – providing top-tier internal platforms and AI-assisted tools to make engineers highly productive and happy (a philosophy Fidelity credits for better software and retention).
    
7. **Partnership & Open Ecosystem:** Extend our reach by integrating with the wider ecosystem. Expose core services via secure APIs/Open Banking interfaces so institutional partners and financial advisors can plug our products into their platforms. Treat external advisors/distributors as another “channel” – e.g. enabling advisory firms to upsell our funds via white-label apps or data feeds. We will prefer open standards and interoperability (supporting initiatives in DeFi, open wealth management protocols, etc., where compliant) to avoid silos.
    

Each principle above will guide decisions and trade-offs, ensuring we stay aligned with our mission while adapting to new opportunities.

## Strategic Pillars

We have defined six strategic technology pillars that translate our vision and principles into focus areas with clear outcomes. Each pillar includes rationale, key capabilities to develop, and how we will measure success.

### Pillar 1: Client Experience & Personalization

**Rationale:** To turn savers into lifelong investors, we must provide a **radically improved customer experience** that is engaging, educational, and tailored to individual needs. In a world of hyper-personalization (where fintechs and Big Tech set high expectations), our omnichannel capabilities must deliver consistent, contextual interactions. Better experiences drive higher NPS, retention, and AUM growth through deeper relationships.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Omnichannel Platform:** A unified customer experience layer spanning mobile app, web portal, smart voice assistants (e.g. Alexa, Google), chat (including large-language-model based chatbots), and advisor in-person/desktop. Customers can start in one channel and seamlessly continue in another with full context (e.g. discuss investment goals with a voice assistant, then see that history when logging into the app). An **“omnichannel hub”** will orchestrate context and hand-offs (for example, transferring a call or chat to a human advisor with the conversation history attached).
    
- **AI-Powered Personalization:** Use machine learning to offer _“segment of one”_ personalization. This includes content (articles, tutorials) matched to the user’s financial literacy level, personalized nudges to save or invest more, and portfolio insights (e.g. “your retirement is on track, consider increasing contribution by 5%”). Next-best-action engines will analyze customer data to suggest relevant products or advice, boosting cross-sell/up-sell conversion – next-best-offer models have been shown to increase sales by up to 30%.
    
- **Digital Personal Advisor (Robo + Hybrid):** Deploy a **virtual investing assistant** (accessible via app chat or voice) powered by generative AI. It can answer FAQs, explain investment concepts, and provide portfolio recommendations within regulatory limits (e.g. using GPT-4 with our proprietary data, under compliance checks). More advanced, it will act like an “AI co-pilot” for clients, providing 24/7 guidance and preparing the ground for human advisors. When needed, it smoothly hands off to a human advisor, along with a summary of the client’s context and questions (improving efficiency and user satisfaction).
    
- **Interactive Financial Education:** Integrate interactive tools and simulators (e.g. retirement planner, goal-based investment calculator) into channels. Use gamification and micro-learning to increase financial literacy, aligning with our mission. Track engagement and knowledge gains. Personalized content feeds (like a “learning path” for new investors) will foster more confident investing behavior.
    

**Measurable Outcomes:**

- _Customer Satisfaction & Loyalty:_ Net Promoter Score (NPS) improvement by 15+ points within 3 years, reflecting delight in new digital experiences. Increase in customer retention rates (especially in the first 2 years of onboarding, turning more first-time savers into long-term investors).
    
- _Engagement & Conversion:_ Double the digital engagement metrics – e.g. active users, session length, product holding per customer – through personalized offers and content. Next-best-action offers to have a conversion lift of >20% (benchmark per industry data).
    
- _Seamless Channel Integration:_ Achieve >90% “continuity rate” for multi-channel interactions (customers can switch channels without re-explaining their issue). Reduce drop-offs during transitions (e.g. when handing off from chatbot to human, track and target minimal churn).
    
- _Adoption of Digital Assistant:_ Target that the AI virtual advisor resolves ~70% of routine inquiries without human intervention (as seen in customer support AI where 70% resolution is possible), leading to faster responses (average query response time < 5 seconds for AI, vs. minutes for human) and high satisfaction (post-interaction CSAT > 4.5/5 for AI-assisted interactions).
    

### Pillar 2: AI-Powered & Data-Driven Enterprise

**Rationale:** Data and AI are the engine of innovation – enabling us to scale personalized advice, automate complex tasks, and manage risk proactively. By 2030, firms that master AI will lead in efficiency and customer insight. We aim to be a leader in **ML and Generative AI adoption** within financial services. This pillar ensures that our decisions are insight-driven and our operations increasingly autonomous, improving both top-line (through personalization, new services) and bottom-line (through automation, risk reduction).

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Enterprise Data Mesh & Analytics Hub:** Build a _real-time data backbone_ across the organization. We will implement a Kafka/Pulsar-based event streaming platform as the “central nervous system” carrying events from all apps (trades, clicks, payments) for instant processing. Domain-aligned data pipelines (data mesh) will publish clean, usable data products. A unified analytics platform (cloud data lakehouse) will allow self-service analytics and AI model development on enterprise data with proper governance. Data quality and timeliness become non-negotiable – moving from overnight batch to intraday or real-time for most data flows.
    
- **AI/ML Platform & Feature Store:** Deploy an “AI factory” that industrializes machine learning. This includes a **feature store** to serve up reusable features for models (e.g. behavioral scores, risk flags) in real time, and automated pipelines for model training, deployment, and monitoring (MLOps). All our ML models – from credit scoring to recommender systems – share a common platform, ensuring consistent governance and faster deployment. “AI-ready” data will be abundant: streaming events feed into online feature computations, so models can react to latest customer actions (e.g. a fraud model evaluating transactions as they occur, or marketing models updating next-best-offer after each client interaction).
    
- **Generative AI & Automation:** Leverage **Generative AI (GenAI)** to revolutionize both customer-facing and internal processes. Examples:
    
    - _Personalized content generation:_ Automated research reports or portfolio summaries for clients, written in plain language by GenAI (and reviewed for compliance). This gives retail investors a private-banking-like personalized touch at scale.
        
    - _AI-assisted software development:_ Roll out generative coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot, or Microsoft’s Copilot in Power Platform) to all developers. This is expected to boost coding productivity by 30–50+% – indeed Goldman Sachs provided such AI tools to 12,000 developers with notable productivity gains. This speeds up delivery of new features and reduces cost.
        
    - _Agentic automation:_ Develop **AI agents** for complex workflows. These are autonomous “digital coworkers” that can handle tasks with decision-making – combining RPA and AI. For example, an AI agent could orchestrate end-to-end loan processing or compliance checks, analyzing documents and making approval decisions under human oversight. By 2029, we envision agentic AI automating entire business processes (with appropriate controls). This will cut manual work and processing times dramatically (e.g. loan approval in seconds vs days).
        
- **AI in Risk & Fraud:** Implement advanced ML for risk management. This includes _adaptive fraud detection_ that continuously learns fraud patterns and flags anomalies in real time (e.g. unusual transaction behavior triggers instant interventions). Also, AI-powered surveillance for compliance (monitor communications for insider trading risk, etc.), and ML models for credit risk and portfolio risk that run scenario simulations faster than traditional methods. Over time, AI should help anticipate and mitigate risks before they materialize (predictive analytics in ops and IT as well – e.g. incident prediction).
    
- **Decision Intelligence:** Use AI to augment human decision-making at all levels. From investment strategy (quant models for asset allocation) to marketing (customer segmentation) to operations (routing workflows), embed algorithms that provide data-driven recommendations. A key capability will be natural language query interfaces to our data (“Ask the data”) so that any user can get insights via an AI assistant, instead of waiting on analysts – democratizing data access.
    

**Measurable Outcomes:**

- _AI Ubiquity & Impact:_ By 2028, at least 75% of customer interactions are influenced by AI (e.g. content or recommendations decided by ML). Internally, target >50% of routine processes automated by AI agents or RPA+AI, freeing staff for higher-value work. Achieve cost savings or avoidance of 20–40% in software development and other processes by 2028 through AI augmentation.
    
- _Model Performance & Adoption:_ Track the performance lift from ML models (e.g. personalization models increase click-through by X, fraud losses reduced by Y%). KPI: double the number of models in production year-over-year initially (moving into dozens by 2026, hundreds by 2030) with robust monitoring. All significant decisions should show evidence of data/AI inputs.
    
- _Data Freshness & Accessibility:_ 95% of critical data available in real-time streams (vs. daily batches). Business users to have self-service access to analytics – measure with a user satisfaction score for data platform and number of active data users.
    
- _Risk Reduction:_ Lower fraud loss rate by, say, >30% via AI detection by 2027. Reduce customer-impacting incidents through predictive maintenance (targeting >40% reduction in critical system downtime by using AI ops). Also ensure compliance metrics (no major breaches of model governance, passing audits of AI systems as per regulations like EU AI Act).
    

### Pillar 3: Composable, Cloud-Native Architecture

**Rationale:** This pillar is about making the organization **nimble, modular, and innovation-ready** through technology architecture. Our ability to deliver new features or integrate new capabilities (like a new partner API or product) depends on having a flexible architecture. By breaking monolithic systems into composable components and leveraging cloud infrastructure, we can achieve the agility of fintech startups while maintaining the robustness of an incumbent. Modularity also means we can swap in new tech (like a new analytics engine) without uprooting entire systems, thus future-proofing our stack.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Microservices & APIs (Domain-Driven Design):** Re-architect core systems into a collection of microservices aligned to business domains (e.g. payments, trading, customer onboarding). Each service is independently deployable and exposes functionality via well-defined REST/GraphQL APIs. We will apply Domain-Driven Design to ensure each bounded context is clear. For example, “Portfolio Management” might be a domain with services for holdings, valuations, tax lot accounting, etc. These domain APIs act like internal Lego blocks that can be reused and combined to form products. New features become a matter of composing existing services or adding a small microservice, rather than modifying a giant monolith. This drastically cuts time-to-market for enhancements.
    
- **Internal Developer Platform (IDP):** Establish a self-service platform for developers (paved road) encompassing CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code templates, and observability. By standardizing toolchains and automating environment setup, teams can go from code to cloud faster and safer. For instance, developers can spin up a dev environment or deploy a microservice with one click, using shared platform services for logging, monitoring, and security. As Fidelity did, we consolidate and reuse core platform capabilities to avoid teams reinventing the wheel. This platform approach improves developer productivity and enforces best practices enterprisewide.
    
- **Cloud Infrastructure & Containerization:** Continue the journey to cloud with a goal of >90% workloads in public cloud by 2026–27 (mirroring peers). We use Kubernetes and containers to deploy microservices in a scalable, portable manner. Burst capacity for high volumes, multi-region active-active for resilience (blue-green deployments to avoid downtime). We leverage AWS’s rich managed services (Aurora DB, Lambda, S3, etc.) and also integrate Azure services where beneficial (Azure AD, Power Platform). Adopt **GitOps** for managing infrastructure (treating config as code in Git, enabling automated, auditable changes).
    
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Embrace an _“event-first”_ approach where services communicate via the event streaming platform (Kafka). This decouples systems – instead of tight point-to-point links, services publish events (e.g. “TradeExecuted”) to the stream which others subscribe to. It improves modularity and real-time data flow. The event log also serves for event sourcing in critical flows, offering replayable history. The result is a **responsive, loosely-coupled architecture** that can easily accommodate new services (just have them tap into relevant event streams). As seen in Revolut’s success, an event-driven microservices design greatly enhances scalability and resilience.
    
- **Front-End Modernization (Micro-Frontends):** Apply the same modular thinking to front-ends. Instead of one big web app, use micro-frontends so different teams can own different UI components or flows (e.g. one team manages the “portfolio widget”, another manages “trade ticket” component). These pieces can be assembled into the web or mobile app shell. This allows parallel development and consistent UX via shared design systems. Also plan for multi-experience delivery: a core set of headless APIs that can feed not only our web/mobile apps but also partner apps or new interfaces like wearables or AR/VR in future.
    
- **Legacy Decoupling & Phased Migration:** We will not boil the ocean. Instead, we systematically wrap legacy systems with APIs and events (“strangle pattern”) to gradually replace them. By 2028, target to decommission at least 60% of remaining legacy modules. Key legacy functions will be exposed via modern interfaces in the interim, so that new development happens on the modern platform and legacy is minimized to backend processing until retired.
    

**Measurable Outcomes:**

- _Agility Metrics:_ Reduce average **feature time-to-market** by at least 50% by 2027 (e.g. if it took 6 months to deliver a major feature, bring it to 3 or less). Measure deployment frequency: from perhaps monthly releases to continuous deployments (multiple times per week or daily on core services). Like Revolut, aim for the capability of releasing as quickly as code is ready.
    
- _Scalability & Resiliency:_ The platform should easily handle 2x current peak volumes with <1s latency for core transactions. 99.99% uptime goal for critical services. Ability to recover from outages in minutes (with active-active and automated failovers). Regular chaos testing to ensure resilience.
    
- _Reusability:_ Track how often services/APIs are reused across projects (metric: e.g. each new digital initiative reuses at least 30% existing APIs, demonstrating composability). Developer satisfaction scores with the internal platform should exceed, say, 9/10 (survey the engineers).
    
- _Legacy Reduction:_ By 2028, legacy footprint (e.g. lines of code or # of legacy applications) reduced by 40%+, and tech platform TCO (total cost of ownership) lowered accordingly. Cloud FinOps will monitor cost efficiency – ensure that the migration is also cost-effective (like Fidelity’s FinOps-driven cloud move which saw cost-per-hour computing drop).
    

### Pillar 4: Digital Assets & Ecosystem Expansion

**Rationale:** The financial industry is being reshaped by blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the tokenization of assets. As a large asset manager, we have an opportunity to **simplify our fund and portfolio supply chain** and reach new markets by leveraging these technologies. This pillar focuses on integrating **blockchain and Web3 innovations** into our business in a compliant, value-adding way. It also covers how we engage with external partners (fintechs, advisors, platforms) to broaden distribution and co-innovate.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Tokenized Funds & Securities:** Pilot and launch tokenized versions of our investment funds. For example, create a blockchain-based share class for a money market fund or ETF. This can enable near-instant settlement (atomic delivery-vs-payment) and 24/7 trading, unlike traditional T+1 or T+2 processes. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and others have proven viability (e.g. BlackRock’s tokenized USD liquidity fund quickly reached $500M+ in AUM in 2024). By 2026, we aim to have a regulatory-approved tokenized fund offering, possibly on a permissioned network or public chain with proper oversight. This simplifies distribution (no lengthy intermediary chains), potentially lowers costs, and appeals to tech-savvy investors.
    
- **On-Chain Settlement & Operations:** Use blockchain ledgers to streamline back-office processes like trade settlement, reconciliation, and shareholder registry. For instance, leveraging smart contracts to automatically reconcile fund unit ownership (token holders = beneficial owners) can remove the need for complex registrar processes. Partnerships with platforms like DTCC or Fintech startups (or using our custodian’s DLT platform) will be explored. The goal is **efficiency** – e.g. cut settlement times from days to seconds, reduce errors and operational risk (no out-of-sync ledgers). Smart contracts could also automate fund administration tasks (fee calculations, compliance rules enforcement).
    
- **Self-Sovereign Identity & Verifiable Credentials:** Implement **decentralized digital identity** for customers and partners. At onboarding, issue customers a digital identity wallet containing verifiable credentials (proof of KYC completion, accreditation status, etc.). This allows instant re-use of KYC across our services (and even with partners, if they trust our credential), improving user experience and reducing compliance cost. It aligns with an industry push for reusable KYC via SSI. For example, a client could prove “I’m an accredited investor” to participate in a private offering by presenting a cryptographic credential, without us re-verifying all documents (the credential is tamper-proof and issued by us). Also explore use of zero-knowledge proofs here – e.g. verify an investor is over 18 or meets certain criteria without revealing full personal data. By 2029, we envision broad use of SSI for login (passwordless, secure access) and transacting, enhancing security and privacy.
    
- **DeFi and Partnerships:** Carefully engage with the DeFi ecosystem in a regulated manner. This could mean providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges for some tokenized funds, or partnering with reputable digital asset platforms to distribute our products. It could also involve exploring new products like offering **yield strategies via DeFi** or insurance via smart contracts – always ensuring compliance with MiCA and other regulations. Another angle is using blockchain for distribution agreements: e.g. smart contracts that automatically split fees with a distribution partner based on on-chain recorded sales. We will monitor and participate in sandbox initiatives with regulators (like Project Guardian in Singapore or similar) to stay at the forefront.
    
- **Advisor & Institutional Platform Integration:** Expand our reach up the value chain by providing technology and products to financial advisors and institutional partners. For example, create APIs or a white-label platform where independent advisors can easily allocate client assets to our funds or models. This might include building model portfolios that advisors on other platforms (e.g. robo-advisor marketplaces) can plug into. Simplifying the “fund supply chain” here means making our products one click away for any advisor or fintech app that wants to include them, akin to how payment APIs made fintech integration easy. By doing this, we become a _partner of choice_ for distribution (like how BlackRock’s Aladdin became industry infrastructure in portfolio management, we aim to provide investing-as-a-service components). We will also leverage Microsoft Dynamics CRM integration to support advisor workflows – e.g. advisors on partner platforms could get our fund analytics or proposals directly in their CRM via plugin.
    

**Measurable Outcomes:**

- _New AUM & Revenue Streams:_ Track AUM brought in via new digital channels (tokenized offerings, partnerships). Aim for, say, 5–10% of net new AUM by 2030 to come from tokenized products or distribution via fintech/advisor APIs. If tokenization grows as projected (1% of global funds by 2030), we want to capture a leadership share of that.
    
- _Efficiency Gains:_ Measure operational KPIs – e.g. settlement times (target T+0 for certain transactions), reduction in operational cost per transaction (smart contracts automation saves X FTE or Y% cost in fund admin). Also fewer errors/fails in settlement (target near-zero, given atomic settlement).
    
- _Client Onboarding & Satisfaction:_ With SSI, onboarding time should reduce dramatically (e.g. repeat KYC checks cut down by 80% for returning clients using a credential). Measure drop-off rates in onboarding – expect improvement due to smoother process. Also track login/security incidents – a move to passwordless could reduce account takeover risk (metrics: # of support issues related to login down).
    
- _Compliance & Risk:_ No increase in compliance breaches – ensure all digital asset initiatives are fully compliant (e.g. secure necessary regulatory approvals for tokenized funds, zero fines). Build internal expertise: by 2026, have a crypto-assets risk framework in place and at least one successful regulatory sandbox participation.
    
- _Ecosystem Engagement:_ Count of partners integrated (e.g. “# of external advisor platforms connected via API” – target 10+ by 2027). And time to onboard a new partner goes down thanks to standardized APIs (target <2 months technical integration).
    

### Pillar 5: Trust, Security & Compliance by Design

**Rationale:** In an era of sophisticated cyber threats, strict regulations, and emerging tech risks (like AI and quantum), sustaining trust is non-negotiable. This pillar ensures that as we innovate, we maintain **rock-solid security, privacy, and compliance**. It addresses data protection, regulatory adherence, and the forward-looking steps to mitigate future risks (like quantum computing breaking encryption, or AI ethical risks). Essentially, it’s about building a _resilient and trustworthy foundation_ so that customers and regulators are confident in our platform.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Cybersecurity & Zero Trust Architecture:** Implement a zero-trust framework – every access request is continuously authenticated and authorized, whether inside or outside the network. Strengthen identity and access management (IAM) – adopt phishing-resistant authentication (like hardware tokens or biometrics), and fine-grained access control for APIs. We’ll use behavioral analytics to detect anomalous user activity (AI-driven security monitoring). Also, expand DevSecOps: security scanning (SAST, DAST) integrated into CI/CD, software supply chain security (as Fidelity does with proxying and scanning all third-party components). Regular penetration testing and bug bounties will help catch issues early.
    
- **Data Privacy & Governance:** Treat customer data with utmost care. Enhance data discovery and cataloging so we know what data we have and control its usage. Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit everywhere; evaluate confidential computing for sensitive workloads. Use **privacy-enhancing technologies** (like differential privacy, homomorphic encryption for certain analytics) to minimize exposure of personal data. Enable fine-tuned data retention and deletion policies to comply with GDPR “right to be forgotten”. We will give users transparency and control over their data (via improved consent and preference centers). Federated data governance (as per data mesh principle) will ensure even decentralized data products adhere to global policies.
    
- **Model Risk Management (AI Governance):** As we deploy ML and GenAI, establish a rigorous governance program for models. All high-impact AI (e.g. credit decision models, personalized advice algorithms) will go through bias testing, documentation, and human-in-the-loop review as required. In line with upcoming EU AI Act requirements, we will maintain documentation and record-keeping for AI systems, ensure quality of training data, and provide transparency (customers should know when they are interacting with AI vs human, and have recourse). An AI Ethics Committee will oversee usage guidelines (for example, ensuring no use of AI that violates fairness or creates undue risk). This mitigates compliance and reputational risk from AI missteps.
    
- **Crypto-Asset Compliance & Risk:** With our foray into digital assets, ensure strict controls around custody, anti-money laundering (AML), and regulatory reporting. We’ll comply with MiCA in EU by its effective dates (full compliance by end of 2024, meaning any token issuance or crypto service meets capital, governance, and disclosure requirements). Implement blockchain analytics tools for monitoring suspicious activities on chain (addressing AML in DeFi). Smart contracts used will undergo formal verification or audits to avoid vulnerabilities. Internally, establish clear accounting and risk treatment for crypto assets on our books. Basically, bring the same rigor to crypto as we do to traditional assets.
    
- **Quantum-Resilience Roadmap:** Prepare early for the advent of quantum computing which could break current encryption. Following NIST guidance, we plan our **transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**. By 2025–26, inventory all cryptographic usage in our systems and identify those that need upgrading. By 2027, begin implementing quantum-resistant algorithms (once standardized by NIST in 2024) in a hybrid mode. Target that by 2030, all critical data and communications use PQC algorithms (since NIST suggests deprecating current 112-bit security by 2030). Also, keep an eye on quantum computing’s progress for use cases – but from a risk lens, ensure data that needs long-term secrecy is protected ahead of time (the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat).
    

**Measurable Outcomes:**

- _Security Posture:_ Maintain **zero major security incidents** (data breach, etc.). Track metrics like critical vulnerabilities found vs. fixed time, and target 100% of critical vulns patched within e.g. 48 hours. Achieve top-quartile security ratings from third-party assessments.
    
- _Compliance:_ Pass all regulatory exams with no material findings. If applying for new digital asset licenses, succeed on first attempt due to strong controls. By 2025, fully comply with EU’s MiCA and AI Act provisions relevant to us – measured by successful audits or self-assessments against those frameworks.
    
- _Resilience & DR:_ Ensure that even under cyber attack or outages, we meet recovery targets. E.g., in cyber resilience drills, critical operations recovered within <1 hour of a simulated large-scale attack. Continuously meet uptime SLAs.
    
- _Customer Trust:_ Use customer trust index or retention as an indirect measure – high trust should reflect in low churn due to security/privacy concerns. Also possibly monitor Net Trust Score via surveys (aim for improvement post-introduction of SSI and security enhancements).
    
- _Quantum Readiness:_ By 2028, have completed at least one end-to-end test of PQC in our environment (a pilot system using only post-quantum algorithms). Internal audit to confirm no lingering legacy crypto by 2030. Essentially be “quantum-safe” ahead of the threat timeline.
    

### Pillar 6: Talent Empowerment & Innovation Culture

**Rationale:** Technology transformation succeeds only with people transformation. This pillar focuses on equipping our teams with modern tools and skills, and fostering a culture that embraces change. We benchmark companies like Revolut for their startup mindset and Fidelity for linking employee satisfaction to customer success. By making our organization a place where talent can experiment, learn, and rapidly deliver, we ensure sustainable innovation from within.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Modern Workforce Tools:** Continue to invest in tools that make employees’ jobs easier and more fulfilling. This includes **low-code/no-code platforms** (such as Microsoft Power Apps, Dynamics 365 customization) so that business users can build or tweak applications with minimal IT dependence, automating their own workflows. It also includes rolling out AI **copilots for employees** in various domains: a coding copilot for developers (we did mention in Pillar 2), an “analysis copilot” for analysts (auto-generating reports or slides), and a “customer service copilot” for call center agents (real-time suggesting answers, completing forms during calls). For instance, Microsoft’s Copilot suite for Office could help write emails or create Excel insights automatically. By 2026, we want every employee to feel they have an AI assistant to offload grunt work.
    
- **Unified Advisor Desktop:** For our advisors and sales teams, create a single digital cockpit that surfaces all relevant client information and AI-driven insights. This integrates CRM (Dynamics 365 as core), portfolio data, interaction history from all channels, and next-best-action suggestions. No more Alt-Tab between 10 systems – one interface with a client 360° view. Incorporating AI, this desktop can highlight cross-sell opportunities or life events (e.g. “Client’s 50th birthday – discuss retirement planning”). It will significantly improve advisor productivity and service quality.
    
- **Upskilling & Agile Organization:** We will invest heavily in training programs for cloud, AI, and DevSecOps skills. By dedicating regular time (like Fidelity’s “Learning Tuesdays” concept), we ensure our workforce keeps pace with new tech. Additionally, propagate agile ways of working beyond IT – multi-disciplinary product teams that rapidly iterate with customer feedback. Encourage internal hackathons and innovation contests to surface bottom-up ideas (with funding for winners to implement). Cultivate internal communities of practice (AI guild, Cloud guild, etc.) to share knowledge.
    
- **Innovation Governance & Lab:** Establish an “Innovation Lab” or Center of Excellence that pilots cutting-edge tech (quantum computing experiments, new fintech APIs, etc.). This lab works closely with business units to trial ideas in a sandbox before scaling. We’ll also maintain a “tech radar” to watch emerging technologies (see Watch-List in Appendix) and periodically reassess how they could disrupt or benefit us. Management will give room for experimentation – e.g. allocate X% of IT budget or time for innovative projects that may not have immediate ROI but build future capability (like a quantum portfolio optimization PoC). Notably, we will pilot **quantum computing for portfolio optimization** in partnership with vendors or cloud providers (following others like Citi’s quantum pilot on AWS Braket), to be ready to leverage quantum advantages when available.
    

**Measurable Outcomes:**

- _Employee Productivity:_ Track efficiency gains from new tools: e.g. developers’ output (maybe measured in story points delivered or deployment frequency) improves 20%+ after AI pair-programmers introduced; operations staff can handle 30% more volume per person due to automation; advisors can manage more clients per advisor (say +15%) effectively thanks to the unified desktop.
    
- _Employee Engagement & Retention:_ Through surveys, target top quartile employee engagement scores in the tech industry. Improved retention of key talent (the best people want to stay because they have great tools and learning opportunities). Anecdotally, being seen as a tech-forward firm helps recruiting (measure via acceptance rate of offers, etc.).
    
- _Training & Certification:_ Number of employees certified in cloud/AI. For example, ensure 80% of developers have at least one cloud certification by 2027, and train 100% of relevant staff on AI basics.
    
- _Innovation Output:_ Count of new ideas piloted from the lab per year; how many make it to production. Ensure a pipeline of at least e.g. 5 experimental initiatives annually (from minor process improvements to big bets). Also track the percentage of revenue coming from products that didn’t exist 3–5 years ago (a measure of innovation – try to grow this fraction).
    
- _Agile Delivery Metrics:_ Increase in velocity of teams, reduction in time spent on manual processes. Also quality: even with faster delivery, maintain or improve quality (defect rates, incident rates). The combination of agile methods and empowered teams should yield not just speed but better outcomes (e.g. fewer project failures, more value delivered).
    

These six pillars work in concert: Pillar 1 drives our customer-facing differentiation, Pillar 2 and 3 provide the technological backbone and intelligence, Pillar 4 opens new frontiers and partnerships, Pillar 5 keeps it all safe and compliant, and Pillar 6 ensures we have the human capability and culture to execute.

## Technology Investment Roadmap

To realize the strategy, we’ve outlined a phased roadmap across three horizons – **Now (2026), Next (2027–28), Beyond (2029–30)** – aligning initiatives to business value milestones. Each initiative is labeled with an effort size (S = small, M = medium, L = large investment) and has success KPIs. This staged approach balances quick wins with foundational build-out and future-facing innovation.

### 2026 – Now / Build

In 2026, we focus on building core platforms and delivering quick wins that demonstrate value. Key initiatives:

- **Cloud Foundation & Dev Platform (L):** Complete migration of remaining critical apps to AWS (and establish Azure integrations for CRM). Set up the Internal Developer Platform with CI/CD, infra-as-code, and container orchestration. _KPI:_ 70%+ of apps running in cloud by end-2026; developer onboarding time cut by 50%.
    
- **Real-Time Data Hub (M):** Deploy Kafka/Pulsar enterprise event bus and begin streaming key data (trades, account updates) through it. Launch the first domain data products (e.g. Customer 360 topic) in our data mesh. _KPI:_ <1-second latency for streaming events, enabling e.g. real-time fraud rules. Use-case: real-time customer balance updates available to all channels.
    
- **AI-Powered Personal Assistant Pilot (M):** Pilot a generative AI chatbot in the retail investor mobile app that answers FAQs and provides basic guidance. Also pilot an internal Copilot for IT to write code (maybe using GitHub Copilot Enterprise). _KPI:_ AI chatbot resolves >50% of user questions without human help (deflection rate), with CSAT > 4/5. Developer Copilot usage by >100 developers, with reported 30% productivity increase (survey).
    
- **Unified Advisor Desktop v1 (S):** Roll out an initial version of the advisor portal integrating CRM (Dynamics) data and a basic single customer view. Perhaps start with one region’s advisory team. _KPI:_ Advisor productivity +10% (can handle more meetings or spend less time on prep). Advisor satisfaction with tools +15%.
    
- **Tokenized Fund Experiment (S):** In collaboration with legal/regulatory, issue a pilot token representing a small internal fund or sandbox portfolio on a blockchain (could be done in a controlled environment for learning). _KPI:_ Successful technical issuance and redemption on-chain with <T+0 settlement. Gain regulatory feedback and internal know-how.
    

Additionally, quick security wins in 2026: implement passwordless login for internal systems (e.g. FIDO2 keys for employees) and MFA for customers; also encrypt all PII in databases.

### 2027–2028 – Next / Accelerate

In 2027–28, we scale successful pilots and introduce more advanced capabilities. Focus is on **acceleration** – more AI, more decentralization, and expanding modularity. Key initiatives:

- **Enterprise AI Enablement (L):** Scale up our AI platform – deploy a feature store in production, integrate ML models into multiple customer journeys (e.g. personalization, risk scoring). Roll out AI assistants across departments (customer service, finance automation). Possibly introduce **AI Agents** for one end-to-end use case (e.g. an AI that autonomously handles fraud disputes or loan approvals within set limits). _KPI:_ At least 5 major processes powered by AI by 2028; measure reduction in manual effort (target 30% FTE reduction in those processes) and improved outcomes (e.g. faster resolution times).
    
- **Omnichannel Experience 2.0 (M):** Implement true channel integration – e.g. enable a customer to switch from chatbot to voice call mid-conversation with full context transfer. Add voice banking via natural language (perhaps through Alexa/Google or our IVR). Also integrate the advisor and self-service channels (e.g. an advisor can see what the client was asking the chatbot earlier). _KPI:_ 90% of multi-channel interactions are seamless (tracked via session IDs); self-service usage up (digital contact ratio >80%).
    
- **Digital Identity & Wallet (M):** Launch a **self-sovereign identity** solution for customers. Offer a mobile wallet where users store their verified ID, KYC credential, and perhaps credentials like “verified accredited investor”. Use this for quick login (scan QR to login) and for sharing verifications with partners. Partner with one or two fintechs to accept our KYC credential to test ecosystem use. _KPI:_ 50,000 customers adopt the SSI wallet by 2028; onboarding time for those customers is cut by 50%. Successful interop with at least 2 external services using verifiable credentials.
    
- **Legacy Core Modernization (L):** By 2027, start migrating a major legacy system (e.g. the fund accounting system or payments engine) to a modern microservices-based or SaaS solution. This is a large effort but critical for long-term agility. Use a strangler approach: gradually move functions to new services. _KPI:_ Decommission at least 25% of legacy code by 2028; system performance and reliability improved (e.g. core batch processes now real-time).
    
- **Expansion of Tokenization & Blockchain (M):** Pending regulatory green light, roll out a **tokenized share class** for a mainstream fund by 2027. Also explore on-chain features like paying fund dividends via stablecoins or enabling a blockchain-based shareholder voting. Develop partnerships with major custodians or crypto exchanges for distribution. _KPI:_ First tokenized fund launched successfully with real investors by 2027; measure settlement speed (aim T+0), and cost (transaction cost per trade down by >20%). Also track AUM in tokenized form (goal: €1bn+ by 2028 across offerings).
    
- **Partner API & B2B Integration (S):** Launch a developer portal for our APIs, allowing advisors/institutional partners to embed our capabilities (e.g. retrieve fund data, execute trades via API). Possibly sign first partnerships where our platform powers another firm’s investing offering (B2B2C model). _KPI:_ 5 partners using our APIs by 2028; additional AUM or revenue from these channels (target €X million).
    

During this period, also focus on compliance enhancements: implement AI model governance tools to document and monitor models (keeping us ahead of AI regulation), and transition crypto algorithms (enable TLS support for post-quantum cipher suites in test environments by 2028).

### 2029–2030 – Beyond / Transform

In 2029–30, we push the frontier with transformative initiatives – preparing for a quantum world, fully exploiting agentic AI, and solidifying a decentralized, platform business model. Flagship initiatives:

- **Quantum Computing Pilot (S):** Run a Proof-of-Concept using a quantum computing service (from IBM, AWS Braket, etc.) for a complex problem like **portfolio optimization** or risk simulation. E.g. use Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to optimize a large portfolio, comparing results to classical methods. Though quantum advantage may still be nascent, this readies us for early benefits. _KPI:_ Successful completion of quantum experiment by 2029; documented results indicating if/where quantum can improve. Ensure team expertise (train X quantum specialists).
    
- **Agentic AI Automation (M):** Deploy advanced autonomous AI agents in production operations. For instance, an AI trader that can execute certain strategies within risk limits, or an AI operations agent that manages data quality issues by itself. These agents will operate under human supervision but take on substantial workloads. _KPI:_ At least one significant function (equivalent to a full team’s responsibility) run end-to-end by AI agent by 2030 (with zero incidents). Monitor efficiency gain, e.g. operations cost on that process down 50%, speed up by 10x.
    
- **Fully Decentralized Services (M):** Experiment with offering a financial product in a fully decentralized way. For example, a blockchain-based investment fund with on-chain governance by investors (DAO-like structure), or integrating with decentralized identity networks for KYC. This is exploratory and will depend on regulatory landscape in 2030. _KPI:_ Launch one “DeFi-native” pilot product by 2030 with at least 1,000 participants – for learning (success measured in insight and tech capability rather than profit initially).
    
- **Core Systems Decommission (L):** By 2030, decommission the last major legacy platform (possibly mainframe-based, etc.). This marks a full transition to our new tech stack. _KPI:_ Legacy % <10% of environment; maintenance cost savings of €X million annually re-allocated to innovation.
    
- **Platform Business & Ecosystem (L):** Transform into an open platform where external developers and partners can create value. Possibly launch a marketplace (for fintechs offering add-ons to our customers) or open up certain services for third-party consumption at scale. Essentially, treat internal capabilities as products for external use (where strategic). _KPI:_ Platform revenues (from partnerships, B2B) constitute significant share (target 10%+ of revenue by 2030). Number of third-party apps in our ecosystem, etc., indicating network effects.
    

Meanwhile, ensure **post-quantum readiness** is achieved by 2030: all cryptography upgraded (KPI: all systems using PQC, older algorithms “disallowed” as NIST mandates). And continue improving ESG and sustainability in tech (by 2030 perhaps shift to green data centers, measure carbon footprint of IT).

The roadmap above is ambitious but achievable. It aligns short-term deliverables with our long-term vision, ensuring continuous delivery of value. Each initiative will be managed with clear ownership and agile execution, adjusting as needed for emerging technologies or regulatory changes.

## Architecture Blueprint

Our target architecture is a **modular, streaming, decoupled platform** often likened to _“financial Lego blocks”_. Below we describe the blueprint and provide a high-level diagram showing its main components and interactions:

**Narrative:** At the top, all **Channels** (from mobile apps and web to voice assistants, wearable interfaces, and partner platforms) connect through a unified **Integration Layer**. This layer includes an API Gateway (handling REST/GraphQL APIs, authentication, rate-limiting) and an Event Streaming Hub (Kafka/Pulsar cluster) that brokers real-time events. Channels either call APIs or subscribe/publish events, enabling both request/response and async styles. For example, when a user makes a trade on the mobile app, an API call goes to trade service, which then emits an event that updates other services and data stores in real-time.

Behind the integration layer lies our **Domain Services & Platforms**. These are grouped by business domains and cross-cutting platforms: we have Microservice Domain APIs for core business logic (e.g. Account Service, Trade Service, Portfolio Service, Payments Service – each encapsulated and independently deployable). They communicate with each other **only via APIs or events**, fostering loose coupling. All changes in state (like a new transaction) are emitted on the Event Hub, so other services (or analytics systems) can react.

Supporting the domain services, we have shared platform components: a **Data Lakehouse & Feature Store** (providing the single source of truth for analytics and ML features – essentially implementing the data mesh, where domain data is exposed as products to this layer for enterprise use). There’s an **AI/ML Services Platform** where models are hosted (e.g. a recommender system or fraud detection model accessible via API, plus a Feature Store that those models use for features). We also have a **Blockchain & Digital Assets platform** – essentially integration to blockchain nodes or DLT networks and smart contract logic for tokenized assets, possibly running on cloud blockchain services or managed nodes.

Crucially, an **Identity & Access Fabric** underpins everything. This is our digital identity layer handling SSO, authentication (for both users and APIs), identity verification, and managing verifiable credentials. It interacts with channels (for user login, biometric auth, etc.), with the API gateway (for authorizing API calls, JWT token issuance), and with blockchain components (e.g. writing identity attestations on ledger, or using decentralized IDs for users).

Security is layered throughout: e.g. API gateway and Identity Fabric enforce zero-trust access, and each service is in its own container with network policies. Observability (logging, tracing) spans across via a central monitoring service.

The architecture is deployable across cloud regions – leveraging cloud-native services (Kubernetes clusters, serverless functions for some event consumers, managed databases, etc.). Data flows in this architecture are **stream-oriented** – e.g., a “CustomerCreated” event flows from the Onboarding Service through Kafka to the Data Lake (for analytics), to the Marketing Service (to trigger a welcome email), etc., without tight coupling.

Overall, this blueprint ensures **high cohesion within services and low coupling between them**, enabling agility. It is **channel-agnostic** (same API and event backbone serves all channels) and **future-proof** (new services can plug in by subscribing to events or exposing an API without disrupting others).

Below is an illustrative diagram in Mermaid syntax:

_Figure: High-level architecture blueprint._ In this diagram, user channels connect via APIs and events. Domain microservices interact through the Event Hub (pub/sub) or direct API calls via the gateway. The Data/AI platforms consume events and data from services to generate insights. The Identity fabric provides authentication/authorization at the edges and issues verifiable credentials (linking to Blockchain for SSI). This Lego-block architecture enables us to add or replace components with minimal impact, supporting innovation and scalability.

## Customer & Employee Experience Map

The following table illustrates how various user journeys (for customers and employees) are supported by technology enablers from our strategy, and what improvements in experience (NPS for customers, productivity for employees) we expect:

|**User Journey & Channel**|**Enabling Technology**|**Expected Improvement (NPS / Productivity)**|

Ops headcount can be reallocated to higher-value tasks; overall operations NPS (internally measured) up due to reduced drudgery.|

_Explanation:_ Each row pairs a user scenario with enabling tech. For customers, the improvements translate to higher Net Promoter Scores (or similar satisfaction metrics). For employees, improvements show in productivity (time saved, capacity increased) and qualitative feedback. For example, the retail investor using the mobile app will get personalized AI insights and find the app easier to use, driving up their satisfaction. The call center agent gets AI help, enabling quicker, more accurate responses, improving both user’s experience and agent’s efficiency. These mappings ensure our tech investments directly support experience enhancements.

## Risk & Compliance Lens

Our strategy is executed with a strong risk management and compliance focus at every step:

- **Data Privacy & Protection:** We strictly adhere to GDPR, CCPA and other data privacy laws in all solutions. Personal data usage is minimized and protected – e.g. using anonymization in analytics, asking for consent for personalized profiling, and enabling customers to control data sharing. We implement “Privacy by Design” in new features (doing privacy impact assessments). All customer data is encrypted (in transit and at rest using strong encryption), with plans to adopt post-quantum encryption algorithms by decade’s end to pre-empt quantum risks. Regular audits of data access are conducted, and any AI that uses personal data will have built-in privacy safeguards (e.g. prompt filtering to avoid leaking sensitive info). We’ll also explore **zero-knowledge proofs** so we can verify attributes (like creditworthiness) without seeing underlying personal details – aligning with emerging privacy tech.
    
- **AI Model Risk & Ethics:** Recognizing that ML and GenAI can pose model risks (bias, error, opacity), we establish robust **AI governance**. All high-risk models (e.g. those affecting credit decisions or personalized advice) go through validation by an independent model risk team. We document model purpose, data, and performance. We monitor outcomes for bias – for instance, ensuring a robo-advisor’s recommendations aren’t inadvertently favoring certain products unfairly. We comply with regulatory expectations (like the EU AI Act’s requirements on data quality, transparency, human oversight for high-risk AI). An ethics board reviews uses of AI – e.g. we avoid using AI in ways that could manipulate or disadvantage customers. Clients are informed when AI is used (no “black box” without disclosure). For Generative AI, we have controls to prevent its misuse (such as filtering outputs, and not allowing GenAI to give investment advice beyond its remit).
    
- **Cybersecurity & Fraud:** Cyber risk is ever-present – we counter it with layered defenses and continuous improvement. We maintain a 24/7 Security Operations Center that leverages AI tools to detect intrusions or anomalies in real-time. Multi-factor authentication is mandatory for all users. We implement **adaptive fraud prevention** in digital channels: AI models watch transactions and login patterns, triggering step-up authentication or blocking when suspected (this “adaptive shield” learns new fraud patterns continuously). Regular penetration tests and red-team exercises will be done to uncover vulnerabilities before attackers do. We also intensify third-party risk management for any tech vendors or partners (ensuring they meet our security standards). KPIs here include time to detect and contain incidents (goal in minutes) and keeping fraud loss ratios below industry benchmarks by leveraging advanced AI detection.
    
- **Regulatory Compliance (Financial & Crypto):** We proactively engage regulators as we adopt new tech. For instance, as we tokenize assets, we ensure compliance with **MiCA** and other securities laws – obtaining necessary licenses where needed, providing required disclosures, and implementing appropriate investor protections (like risk warnings, limits on who can buy certain tokens). We keep regulators informed through sandboxes or innovation hubs to avoid surprises. Internally, our compliance department is upskilled on digital assets and AI. We update policies – e.g. updating our suitability assessments to account for AI-generated advice, or adjusting record-keeping to capture communications via new channels (like chatbots). We also track emerging rules: e.g. the EU’s crypto travel rule (info-sharing for transfers) and ensure our systems can comply. For quantum, while not regulated yet, we treat it as operational risk – following NIST roadmap to transition crypto before regulations mandate.
    
- **Resilience & Business Continuity:** Hand in hand with risk is ensuring the business is always available and recoverable. Our cloud architecture is built with resilience (multi-region deployment, automated failover). We regularly test disaster recovery, including scenarios like cloud provider outages, cyberattacks, or data corruption. By leveraging event sourcing and multiple data replicas, we can recover state from immutable logs if needed. We also consider concentration risk – e.g. using multi-cloud or on-prem backups for critical systems in case one cloud has a major incident. Business continuity plans are updated to cover new tech (for example, if our AI systems fail or misbehave, we have human fallback processes).
    

In summary, **we do not pursue innovation at the expense of control**. Every tech initiative is reviewed by security and compliance teams as stakeholders. We treat regulations as a floor, not a ceiling – aiming to exceed minimum standards to build trust. By anticipating future risks (AI, quantum) and addressing them now, we ensure that our platform remains safe and compliant, which is essential for retaining customer confidence and our license to operate.

## Key Milestones & Decision Gates

To govern execution, we establish milestones with clear owners and “go/no-go” criteria. These checkpoints ensure accountability and allow course correction. Below are 10 key milestones from 2025 through 2030:

1. **Q4 2025 – Cloud & Platform Foundation Ready** – _Owner:_ CTO (Cloud Engineering Lead). _Milestone:_ Core cloud infrastructure set up (landing zones, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes clusters) and first wave of applications moved to cloud. _Criteria:_ At least 50% of customer-facing workloads in AWS; Dev portal operational with pilot teams; Security sign-off on cloud controls (passed audit). _Go:_ if performance/cost meets expectations (e.g. cost per transaction down, no major issues). _No-go:_ if significant outages or cost overruns – decision to optimize or pause migrations.
    
2. **Q2 2026 – AI Pilot Success & Scale Decision** – _Owner:_ Chief Data & AI Officer. _Milestone:_ Evaluation of AI chatbot pilot and coding copilot usage. _Criteria:_ Chatbot achieves >50% self-service resolution with high CSAT, and developer AI tool adoption >70% of target users with productivity gain evidence. _Decision:_ Go to scale these AI solutions enterprise-wide (or iterate more if criteria not met). Also ensure compliance (model risk evaluated, no adverse incidents) before scaling.
    
3. **Q4 2026 – Omnichannel Launch** – _Owner:_ Head of Digital Product. _Milestone:_ New mobile app and web experience rolled out with personalization and omnichannel integration (phase 1). _Criteria:_ NPS improvement by >5 points in pilot group; system stability (no major regression); adoption of new features (e.g. X% of users trying AI insights). _Decision:_ If NPS gains are marginal or issues found, hold for fixes; if positive, decommission old channels and fully launch new UX to all customers.
    
4. **Q1 2027 – Regulatory Green Light for Tokenized Fund** – _Owner:_ General Counsel / Head of Product. _Milestone:_ Approval obtained (or at least no-objection) from regulators to launch a tokenized fund product. _Criteria:_ Legal/compliance sign-off, robust custody and investor protection model in place. _Decision Gate:_ If approval is not granted or conditions too onerous, decide whether to pivot (e.g. focus on private blockchain or delay launch). If go, proceed to live launch.
    
5. **Q3 2027 – Legacy Decommission Checkpoint** – _Owner:_ Head of IT Modernization. _Milestone:_ At least 20% of targeted legacy systems retired or frozen (no new development) by this date. _Criteria:_ New microservice replacements running without issues for 6+ months, user acceptance positive. _Decision:_ If behind target (e.g. less than 10% done), reassess approach (invest more resources or consider alternate strategy like COTS solutions). If on track, continue phased decommissions, and maybe accelerate timeline for remaining 80%.
    
6. **Q4 2027 – SSI & Digital ID Go-Live** – _Owner:_ Chief Security Officer (for Identity) and Chief Customer Officer. _Milestone:_ Self-sovereign identity wallet available to customers with at least one use-case (login or data sharing) fully functional. _Criteria:_ Successful beta with employees/internal users; no security flaws (penetration test passed); decent adoption in pilot (e.g. 5k users, positive feedback). _Decision:_ Go to public launch if criteria met; if not, fix issues or reconsider approach (maybe partner with an identity network).
    
7. **Q2 2028 – Partnership Ecosystem Review** – _Owner:_ Head of Partnerships. _Milestone:_ Evaluate uptake and performance of APIs and partnerships. _Criteria:_ Number of partners integrated (target ~5), AUM inflow via partners (target €X million), partner feedback (must be positive NPS from partners). _Decision:_ If below expectations, investigate bottlenecks (e.g. API problems or lack of marketing) – decide on corrective actions or shifting strategy (maybe building white-label solutions if direct API not catching on). If above target, invest more in platform features for partners.
    
8. **Q4 2028 – AI Governance & Risk Assessment** – _Owner:_ Chief Risk Officer (with AI governance board). _Milestone:_ Comprehensive review of AI systems in production, in light of any new regulations (EU AI Act enforcement, etc.). _Criteria:_ All high-risk AI systems documented, bias testing results acceptable, incident log empty (no major AI failures). _Decision Gate:_ If gaps found (e.g. unidentified bias, or regulatory requirements not met), potentially suspend some AI features until fixed. Could impose a slower rollout or implement additional controls. If all clear, proceed confidently with advanced AI (like agentic automation next phase).
    
9. **Q1 2029 – Quantum Readiness Decision** – _Owner:_ CTO / Chief Scientist. _Milestone:_ Based on progress in PQC transition and quantum computing PoCs, decide on any acceleration. _Criteria:_ If by 2029 a cryptographically relevant quantum computer appears imminent (per NIST or industry news), ensure PQC rollout is nearing completion (target all critical channels PQC by end of year). Also evaluate results of quantum portfolio optimization PoC. _Decision:_ If PQC transition lags, might need to allocate emergency program resources (cannot miss 2030 deadline). If quantum PoC shows clear advantage, decide to invest in real quantum algorithms development (or hardware partnerships) – essentially a go/no-go on moving quantum from lab to more production by 2030.
    
10. **Q4 2030 – Strategy Outcomes Review** – _Owner:_ Group Head of Architecture (and entire C-suite). _Milestone:_ End of 2030 review against this strategy’s goals. _Criteria:_ Evaluate metrics: customer NPS target achieved? Cost-income ratio improved via tech? Market share gains? Legacy <10%? etc. _Decision:_ Determine new 5-year strategy focus. If we met most targets, set new ambitions (maybe global expansion of platform, etc.). If any pillars under-delivered, analyze why (technology, adoption, external factors) and adjust future strategy accordingly. Essentially, this is the final gate to learn and iterate on our strategic planning.
    

Each milestone is not only a check on progress but a decision point to either continue as planned, course-correct, or in rare cases, roll back an approach. By assigning clear owners (the persona who is accountable) and criteria for success, we make the execution of this strategy **transparent and accountable** to executive leadership.

## Appendix

### Glossary

- **AUM (Assets Under Management):** Total market value of assets a financial institution manages on behalf of clients. In our context, >€800bn across funds and portfolios.
    
- **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. API-first means designing systems to expose services via stable interfaces from the start.
    
- **Microservices:** An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services, each running in its own process and communicating via lightweight mechanisms (like HTTP APIs or events). Enables modular development and deployment.
    
- **Event Hub / Kafka / Pulsar:** Middleware that allows asynchronous, publish/subscribe messaging. Apache Kafka and Pulsar are distributed systems for high-throughput event streaming, used to decouple producers and consumers of data in real time.
    
- **Data Mesh:** A decentralized data architecture concept where domain teams own “data as a product”, and a federated governance model ensures standards. Opposite of monolithic data lake – it emphasizes domain-driven design in data.
    
- **Feature Store:** A central repository for ML features – preprocessed data attributes fed into models. It ensures consistency between training and inference and feature reuse across models.
    
- **Generative AI (GenAI):** AI that can generate new content (text, images, code, etc.) using models like GPT. In our use, it generates advice text, code suggestions, customer communications, etc.
    
- **Agentic AI / AI Agents:** Software agents powered by AI that can take actions autonomously towards goals. They have some “agency” to make decisions (within limits) rather than just passively output predictions. Used for automating complex workflows.
    
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):** A model for digital identity where individuals (or organizations) fully own and control their identity information using digital wallets, and share verifiable credentials peer-to-peer. No single central authority retains all personal data; trust is established through cryptography.
    
- **Verifiable Credential:** A tamper-proof digital credential (e.g. ID, certificate) that can be cryptographically verified. Often used in SSI – e.g. a driver’s license credential issued by DMV that you can present digitally, which anyone can verify came from DMV and wasn’t altered.
    
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP):** A cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information. E.g. prove “age > 18” without revealing birthdate. Useful for privacy-preserving verification.
    
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Cryptographic algorithms believed to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. NIST is standardizing these as current RSA/ECC might be broken by quantum in future. Transitioning to PQC is crucial by 2030–35.
    
- **Zero Trust:** A security principle that assumes no implicit trust for any user or system, even if inside the perimeter. Verify everything (identity, device, intent) before granting access, and enforce least privilege.
    
- **DevOps / GitOps:** DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together through the entire service lifecycle, with automation and monitoring. GitOps is a way to implement DevOps where the single source of truth for infrastructure and app configurations is Git – changes are made via Git commits which trigger automated deploys.
    
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score):** A metric for customer satisfaction and loyalty, measured by asking customers how likely they are to recommend the company (promoters minus detractors). Used here to gauge CX improvements.
    
- **CSAT:** Customer Satisfaction score, often measured on a 1–5 scale after interactions. Used for support and service quality measurement.
    
- **KPI:** Key Performance Indicator. We’ve attached KPIs to initiatives to quantify success (e.g. % increases, time reductions, etc.).
    

### Vendor/Partner Scan

To execute this strategy, we will consider or leverage various vendors and partners:

- **Cloud Providers:** AWS (primary cloud for compute, storage, AI services), Azure (complementary, especially for Microsoft-specific tech like Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Azure AD; also possibly Azure Quantum for quantum experiments). Multi-cloud strategy to avoid lock-in and use best-of-breed.
    
- **SaaS Platforms:** Microsoft Dynamics 365 for CRM (advisor workflow, client data), Microsoft 365 (Office, Teams for collaboration). We’ll closely watch Microsoft’s **Copilot** offerings in Office and Dynamics to integrate AI features. For core banking functions, evaluate SaaS or modern vendors (if not building in-house) such as core ledgers (Thought Machine’s Vault, 10x Future Tech) especially if they align with our microservices approach.
    
- **AI/ML Tech:** OpenAI or Azure OpenAI for GPT models (assuming compliance can be managed) to power GenAI features. Alternatively, use local large language models (LLMs) via providers like HuggingFace or Cohere for data privacy. ML Ops and feature store vendors like Databricks (Feature Store), or open-source Feast, or Tecton. Cloud-native AI tools like AWS SageMaker could be leveraged too. For AI coding assist, GitHub Copilot (Microsoft).
    
- **Fraud/Risk Tech:** Firms like FeatureSpace, FeedzAI, or in-house AI for fraud detection. Possibly consider Palantir or Quantexa for AML analytics (though may prefer building in-house with our AI platform).
    
- **Blockchain & Identity:** Partner with digital asset infrastructure providers: e.g. Fireblocks or Metaco for crypto custody integration, R3 Corda or Hyperledger for permissioned blockchain needs, or public chain providers (Ethereum layer-2 networks, etc.) for tokenization. For identity, vendors like IBM’s digital credentials platform or startups like Evernym/Avast (for SSI) could accelerate development. We may join identity trust networks (e.g. Sovrin or EU’s EBSI network) for broader SSI adoption.
    
- **Developer Tools:** Kubernetes (maybe Amazon EKS or Azure AKS managed service), Terraform for IaC, GitHub or GitLab for repo and CI. JFrog or similar artifact management (as Fidelity uses Artifactory to secure supply chain). Observability from Datadog or New Relic or open-source Prometheus/Grafana stack.
    
- **Consulting & Integration Partners:** We may engage firms like Accenture, Deloitte or Capco for specific expertise (e.g. setting up data mesh governance, or quantum computing use-case discovery). However, given our focus on talent, we aim to build strong in-house capability and use partners tactically for niche help or capacity boosts.
    
- **Fintech Collaborations:** Fintechs that could plug into our ecosystem – robo-advisors, personal finance management apps, etc. Possibly partner with neobanks or wealthtech startups to embed our investment products (B2B2C model). E.g., partner with a neo-broker to list tokenized funds, or with an AI fintech that provides a cutting-edge feature we can integrate rather than build (like an innovative financial planning tool).
    
- **Benchmark Peers:** We keep an eye on Fidelity (their cloud and platform engineering success), Vanguard, BlackRock for large-scale ops; Revolut and Robinhood for tech-driven innovation (Revolut’s event-driven architecture and extreme DevOps automation are reference points). Also look at Big Tech entrants like Amazon, who offer financial services components, to potentially leverage or differentiate against.
    

We will continuously scan the market; the vendor landscape is dynamic, especially in AI and blockchain. Our strategy is to remain largely cloud-agnostic with modular architecture so we can slot in new best-in-class components as they emerge (for instance, if a new GenAI provider outperforms existing ones, we can integrate its API without rearchitecting).

### Emerging Tech “Watch-List”

The tech world in 2025–2030 will evolve rapidly. We will maintain a watch-list of emerging technologies and trends that, while not core to our current strategy, could become relevant “next big things” to incorporate:

- **Small Modular AI Models (Edge AI):** There’s a trend toward smaller, specialized AI models that can run on-device (for privacy and speed). E.g. personalized models on the user’s phone (maybe for personalized advice without data leaving device). We watch projects like federated learning and edge AI chips that might allow us to push AI to the edge securely.
    
- **Spatial Computing & AR/VR:** With advancements like Apple’s Vision Pro, the way customers interact might extend to augmented or virtual reality. In a 2030 scenario, an investor could walk through a virtual reality “financial wellness experience” or have AR overlays with financial info. We keep an eye on AR interfaces for possible use in education or advisory contexts.
    
- **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI):** It’s futuristic, but companies like Neuralink are pushing BCI. Not immediately relevant, but as an extreme watch, if human-computer interaction paradigms shift (e.g. think a future where a user can think “invest $100” and an action happens), we’d want to be conceptually ready.
    
- **Green Tech & IT Sustainability:** Innovations in making data centers and computing more energy-efficient (quantum computing could be one, also new cooling tech, renewable-powered clouds). As ESG is important, tech that reduces carbon footprint of our IT (like workload optimization for energy or perhaps blockchain solutions that are carbon-neutral) will be evaluated.
    
- **RegTech and SupTech:** AI for regulatory compliance (like automated regulation monitoring, or tools to simulate the impact of new rules on our portfolio). While we have compliance covered, new tech that eases compliance burdens or improves reporting (e.g. using blockchain for regulatory reporting) is of interest.
    
- **Advanced Cryptography:** Beyond ZKP, areas like Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption might allow new services (e.g. compute on encrypted data to offer insights without seeing raw data). Also, new identity frameworks post-SSI, like decentralized social recovery wallets, etc.
    
- **Biosecurity & Pandemics tech:** Unrelated to finance directly, but as COVID taught, external events affect operations. Tech for remote work enhancement, pandemic modeling, etc., could indirectly matter to keep business running and manage risk in crisis scenarios.
    
- **Robotics & Automation in Workplace:** Not directly for a financial firm’s core, but we watch how physical automation (like robots in branch operations or automated document handling with computer vision) could assist some operations.
    
- **Quantum Communication:** In addition to quantum computing, quantum key distribution (QKD) might become practical for ultra-secure communication lines (for our most sensitive data centers). It’s niche, but we’ll watch any maturity here.

Our architecture’s **flexibility is our hedge** against future tech shocks – by staying modular, API-driven, and cloud-based, we can plug in new technologies or adapt to new paradigms more easily. The Watch-List will be reviewed quarterly by the Architecture and Innovation teams to consider if any items should move into active roadmap.

Finally, as we progress, we remain open to **rethinking assumptions**. The financial world of 2030 might include completely new concepts (perhaps central bank digital currencies at scale, or new investor behaviors from Gen Z and beyond). Our strategy, therefore, is a living framework – principled but adaptable, ensuring we can continuously “change the way the world invests” in alignment with our mission.
