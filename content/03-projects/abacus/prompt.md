You are tasked with conducting deep research to craft a detailed business plan and strategic roadmap for launching an independent spinout entity from an existing B2C personal investor platform based in the UK. This new entity, named **Abacus**, will serve as an innovation sandbox to explore new business strategies, technologies, and financial products, initially marketed as **"powered by TurtleInc"**.

### Objectives:

- Experiment with innovative business lines such as tokenised money market funds and stable coins.
    
- Utilize modern architecture principles—modularity, decoupling, resilience, and scalability.
    
- Evaluate and pilot emerging technologies: agentic AI, digital identities, fractional share ownership via tokenised assets.
    
- Explore partnerships with third-party providers for strategic functionalities (buy vs. build analysis).
    
- Establish a live sandbox for evaluating new financial products, assessing technological ROI, and testing regulatory compliance.
    
### Personas to Adopt:

In your deep research and strategy work, take on the perspectives of the following personas to ensure a comprehensive and cross-functional analysis:

1. **Strategic Product Owner** – Focused on innovation alignment, business model validation, market fit, and long-term vision.
    
2. **Enterprise Architect** – Concerned with modularity, scalability, cloud-native infrastructure, integration with legacy systems, and architectural trade-offs.
    
3. **Head of Compliance & Risk** – Responsible for aligning all activities with FCA and other regulatory frameworks.
    
4. **FinTech CTO** – Balancing cutting-edge experimentation with real-world delivery feasibility; exploring technologies such as agentic AI, tokenisation, and digital identity.
    
5. **Finance Lead** – Constructing robust cost vs. ROI models, evaluating funding requirements and long-term economic viability.
    
6. **AI Solutions Engineer** – Mapping where and how to integrate AI tools to accelerate the SDLC, streamline decision-making, and add business value.
    
### Deliverables:

#### 1. Strategic Business Plan

- Clearly define the mission, vision, and strategic objectives for Abacus.
    
- Identify key business opportunities, challenges, and competitive analysis.
    
- Assess regulatory considerations and compliance frameworks with emphasis on FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) regulations.
    

#### 2. Financial Model (Cost vs. ROI Analysis)

- Detailed financial projections, cost structures, and potential revenue streams.
    
- Comprehensive ROI analysis for new technologies, architecture investments, and third-party integrations.
    

#### 3. Resource Planning for MVP/Alpha Development

- Minimum viable organizational setup (legal, administrative, operational requirements).
    
- Required human resources: business SMEs for capability design, technical resources for platform development, regulatory specialists.
    
- Estimated infrastructure and technology costs.
    

#### 4. Technology and Architecture Analysis

- Deep analysis of modern architectural patterns ensuring modularity, decoupling, scalability, and resilience.
    
- Recommendations for initial architecture setup and required technology stack.
    
- Define an initial reference architecture and include detailed C4 architecture diagrams in Mermaid format.
    

#### 5. AI Tools Leveraging

- Describe the end-to-end Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) workflow from discovery through to delivery, with an emphasis on how AI tools can be embedded throughout the process to reduce overhead and accelerate execution.
    
- Evaluate AI tools (Windsurf, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Writer, etc.) for potential operational efficiencies.
    
- Recommend specific AI tools to reduce initial capital investment and accelerate MVP development.
    
- Provide insights on integrating AI-driven functionalities into the business operations and customer experience.
